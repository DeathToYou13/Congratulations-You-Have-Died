
The Approach:
Kaelen doesn't sneak in. He phases in.
Guards don't see him coming. Just suddenly someone's down. Then another. Then another.
Not dead. Dismantled.

Dislocated shoulders
Shattered kneecaps
Precisely broken fingers
Unconscious, breathing, alive
But BROKEN

Surgical. Efficient. Silent.
By the time he reaches Cassius's chambers, half the wing is down and NO ONE saw him.

The Taking:
Cassius in his office. Senses something wrong.
Turns.
Kaelen is already there. Mistwalker mid-room. No door opened. Just... present.
No words.
Just movement:

Cassius weaves Shadeweave → Kaelen's already behind him (Drift through the casting)
Dagger to spine → not penetrating, just PRESSURE at the exact vertebra that would paralyze
Cassius tries to speak → Kaelen's other hand over his mouth
Cassius tries to struggle → Something breaks (finger? wrist?)

Then Kaelen speaks. First words. Whisper:

"The Standing Tide. My parents. Five years old. Remember?"

Cassius's eyes widen. Recognition. Horror.

"You're going to walk. Front door. Quiet. Every sound you make, I break something. Understand?"

Cassius nods frantically.

The Dismantling:
Before they leave, Kaelen demonstrates.
Not for cruelty. For compliance.
Quick, brutal, methodical:

Dislocates Cassius's shoulder (clean pop, perfect technique)
Breaks two fingers on his casting hand (no Shadeweave now)
Does something to his knee (not broken, but walking hurts)
Uses Threadwalk to bind his hands with his own robes (impossible knots)

No emotion. Just: This is what happens if you resist.
Cassius is WEEPING. From pain, from fear, from the sheer clinical precision of it.

Kaelen: "Still want to resist?"

Cassius shakes his head violently.

Kaelen: "Good. Front door. Now."


The Walk:
Kaelen doesn't hide. Doesn't sneak.
Walks Cassius through the fortress. Front doors.
Every corridor:

Guards see them
Hands go to weapons
Eyes widen
Someone starts to move—

Kaelen looks at them.
Not a glare. Not anger. Just... attention.
Pure predator focus. The look an apex hunter gives prey: I see you. I can end you. Choose.
And they freeze.
Because what they see in that 12-year-old's eyes is someone who has ALREADY decided their death is acceptable. Someone who won't hesitate. Won't blink. Will just... act.
The guards who passed unconscious colleagues in the halls? They've seen what he's capable of.
They let him pass.

Cassius's Pleas:
Halfway through, a captain musters courage. Steps forward. "Release the High Arbiter or—"
Cassius: "NO! Don't—don't move. Please. Just let him—"
Captain stares. The HIGH ARBITER is BEGGING?
Cassius: [Voice breaking] "He'll kill me. He'll kill me and there's nothing—he WILL. Just—just let him take me. Please."
The captain looks at Kaelen. Sees a child. Small, lean, probably 120 pounds soaking wet.
But that child has Cassius—the man who tortured nobles, who defied princesses, who commanded armies—reduced to a sobbing, broken thing.
The captain steps aside.

The Psychology:
What did Kaelen DO to Cassius in those chambers that made him this compliant?
Not torture for information.
Education.
Kaelen showed him—methodically, precisely—exactly how easy it would be to kill him:

"This angle, your heart stops."
"This pressure point, brain hemorrhage."
"This twist, spine severs."
"I could do any of these. Right now. And no one would reach us in time."

Then: "But I'm not going to. Because you're going to trial. You're going to answer for everything."
The mercy is MORE terrifying than the threat.
Cassius realizes: This child COULD murder him. WANTS to murder him. Is CHOOSING not to.
And that choice could CHANGE at any second.
So Cassius becomes the most compliant prisoner in history. Because the alternative is a dagger in precise locations Kaelen has ALREADY mapped.

The Delivery:
Kaelen walks through MAIN GATES.
Conclave guards watching. Nobles in the plaza. Merchants. Citizens.
Everyone sees:
A child walking a High Arbiter through the street like a prisoner. Cassius limping, hands bound, weeping quietly.
No one interferes.
They reach Aurelián forces / Royal Guard / whoever's coordinating.
Kaelen throws Cassius at their feet. (Literally. Shoves him down.)

Kaelen: "High Arbiter Cassius Mordas. Captured. Alive. He's yours."

Then turns to leave.
Someone: "How did you—"
Kaelen: [Over shoulder, not stopping] "He killed my parents seven years ago. I took him. Now you judge him."
First emotion shown: Voice cracks on "parents." Just slightly. Then he's GONE (Veilstep, proper use).

The Aftermath:
What the Conclave/witnesses saw:
A child infiltrated their fortress, neutralized guards, captured their leader, and walked him out the front door. Without backup. Without permission. Without PLAN beyond "take him."
Message received: This Pack? They're not playing academy politics anymore. They're LETHAL when you threaten their own.
What Cassius tells interrogators:

"He was EVERYWHERE. I couldn't track him. Couldn't hit him. He knew—he knew exactly where to hurt me. Exactly how much force. He could've killed me thirty times. Thirty different ways. He SHOWED me."
"That wasn't a child. That was something wearing a child's face. And I'm only alive because he CHOSE to let me live."

The Conclave's internal assessment:

"Kaelen Thorne. Age 12. Rogue discipline. Flowcraft specialty. Previously assessed as 'promising scout potential, requires supervision.'
REASSESSMENT: Lethal solo operator. Extreme threat level. DO NOT ENGAGE without overwhelming force."


The Pack's Reaction:
They weren't there. Didn't know he went. Just... he disappeared during the chaos.
Hours later, he returns. Quiet. No jokes.
Ethan: "Where were you?"
Kaelen: "Cassius. I took him. He's with your people now."
Silence.
Ralen: "You... took Cassius. Alone. From the Conclave fortress."
Kaelen: "Yes."
Ralen: "...How?"
Kaelen: [Shrugs] "I'm good at getting places I shouldn't be."
Mira: "Kaelen. What did you DO?"
Kaelen: [First real emotion - voice hollow] "What my parents taught me. Did what was right. No matter the cost."
Long pause.
Kaelen: "I wanted to kill him. I REALLY wanted to. Every second. Every step. Just... one move. End it."
Mira: "But you didn't."
Kaelen: "No. Because they wouldn't want that. They'd want him to face what he did. To answer for it. So that's what I gave them."
Sienna: "You brought him to justice."
Kaelen: [Bitter laugh] "I brutalized a man and dragged him through the street. Not sure that's justice."
Brenn: "You COULD have killed him. Chose not to. That's justice."
Kaelen looks at his hands. They're not shaking. They should be. He expected them to shake.
Ethan: "You okay?"
Kaelen: [Long pause] "No. But I'm still standing."

The Themes:
"Still standing" — Morally upright. Didn't compromise. Didn't become murderer.
"The Thorn" — Protected the roses (Pack, kingdom) by removing the threat.
"Doing what's right, no matter the cost" — Cost = NOT taking revenge. Cost = carrying the weight of what he's CAPABLE of. Cost = everyone now seeing him differently.
Humor as defiance — Gone completely during mission. Returns slowly after. But it's DIFFERENT now. Weighted. Chosen joy despite knowing he's a weapon.
