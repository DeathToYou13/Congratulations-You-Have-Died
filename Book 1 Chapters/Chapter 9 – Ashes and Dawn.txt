Chapter 9 – Ashes and Dawn

The pack headed straight to the infirmary. The corridors still smelled faintly of scorched air and wet stone, like the building itself had been sweating out what it had seen. Ethan kept pace with Ralen, who walked a half-step ahead as if he could shorten the distance by will alone. Sienna and Brenn trailed close, too quiet for themselves. Liora hugged a satchel to her chest, knuckles pale against the strap.

At the white-arched entry, a ward burned a steady green above the door. A pair of healers in slate-gray tabards stood guard. One held out a flat palm before Ralen could speak.

“No visitors tonight,” she said. Not unkind, but unbending. “They’re stabilized. That’s all you need right now.”

Ralen’s jaw worked. “We just need a minute.”

“You need sleep,” the other healer replied. He was younger, eyes rimmed red. “If we let one minute in, we’ll be letting in a hundred. Come back at dawn.”

Ralen’s hands flexed, engagement and retreat in the same breath. Ethan touched his arm once. “They’re alive,” he said, as much for himself as for Ralen. “We heard that from them. That’s enough for tonight.”

Sienna exhaled. “Barely.”

Liora’s voice was small. “Do we… leave something? For them to see when they wake?”

The older healer glanced toward a shelf by the door already cluttered with ribbons, a charm bracelet, folded notes. “If you must. We can’t promise when they’ll see it.”

They didn’t have much. Sienna pulled a narrow strip of red cloth from her sleeve—spare binding from practice—and tied it to a peg. Brenn set a small carved stone on the shelf, smooth as river glass. Liora wrote three lines on a paper scrap and slid it under the stone, then hesitated and added a fourth. Ralen didn’t move. He stared past the healers toward the hall beyond, where green light pooled around closed doors.

Ethan stepped up, put his hand on the edge of the shelf, and left nothing. He didn’t have a token that could hold what he needed to say.

The younger healer softened a fraction. “Dawn,” he repeated. “First bell.”

Ralen nodded, once, a promise he didn’t like making. They turned away.

The dining hall hadn’t emptied so much as fallen inward. No clatter, no jokes thrown across tables, no chairs dragged with careless force. People ate because they had to, taking small bites and chewing longer than necessary. The noise that remained sounded like a stream under winter ice: there, but contained.

They took a table along the far wall, away from the hearth. A platter of something hot and savory steamed between them. No one reached for it at first. Ethan watched the curl of the steam, wishing it carried words.

“Eat,” Brenn said finally, a gentle order. He broke bread and passed pieces around. When Sienna’s hands shook, he set her portion down for her.

Ralen chewed like he was trying to break a curse. Sienna forced a mouthful, swallowed, stared at the table. Liora drank water in small, fast swallows, like she was trying to rinse something out of her mouth.

From another table, someone whispered, “Was that part of the trial?” Someone else answered, “It can’t be. It wasn’t… right.” A third voice: “Proctor Kane called it. She never calls it.” The words slid through the hall and fell flat.

Sienna set down her cup. “I’ve seen the Spire bend its rules to make a point,” she said, eyes on the table. “But that wasn’t a point. That was a tear.” She rubbed a thumb over the rim of her cup. “And it knew her. It said her name like it kept it somewhere.”

“Demons hoard names,” Liora murmured. “It gives them leverage. Or comfort.” She hesitated, then added quietly, “When it appeared, I saw threads in the air… shade-colored, like Draemir weaves. I’m not saying he caused it—maybe he didn’t even know—but his magic was there. I felt it in the tear.”

Ralen frowned. “You’re sure?”

“Not sure,” she said. “Just… certain enough to wish I wasn’t.”

Silence followed—a ripple of unease none of them wanted to feed. Sienna finally cleared her throat. “Then let’s hope it was an accident.”

Ralen’s gaze stayed fixed on the far wall, like he could see through it to the infirmary. “She told it to go. And it listened.”

“She paid for that,” Sienna said, too fast. She caught herself and added, softer, “A lot.”

Brenn broke more bread. “It didn’t belong. She made it remember that.” He looked to Ethan. “What else did it say?” The question wasn’t an accusation. It was a hand held out, palm up.

Ethan felt the weight of every eye at the table—even when the others tried not to stare. He thought of the demon’s voice layered wrong, of the way it had said the word dragons like it was pulling something old into the room by the throat. But the part that had stuck between his ribs had been smaller and closer: little phrases thrown toward him like hooks. Heir. Bright. Burn.

“It was… reaching,” he said carefully. “Throwing lines to see what caught.”

“Some of them landed,” Ralen said.

Ethan kept his voice low. “Not on me alone. It knew about Mira’s line. It—” He stopped. Across the hall, two instructors spoke in undertones, heads tipped close. A third moved among the tables without touching food, eyes counting.

Sienna kept her gaze on her plate, as if that could hide what they were saying. “It said radiant.” The word felt too loud even in a whisper.

A small hush opened at their table, the sort that makes a person aware of their own heartbeat. Ethan glanced at the nearest groups. No one seemed to be listening. That didn’t mean no one was listening.

I'd been sparring with Ralen, my practice sword clashing against his axe, when a surge of mana—unbidden, radiant—had flared in my palm. For a heartbeat, I felt something vast underneath, like standing on thin ice over a fathomless ocean. The light wanted to rise, to answer something I couldn't name. Then I slammed it down, and the moment passed. The blade glowed briefly, a pulse of light that startled us both. I'd played it off as a trick of the sun, but Ralen's frown lingered, and my system had pinged:

[System Alert: Mana Control +1 -- Progress 46%]
[System Alert: Warning -- Uncontrolled Radiant Surge Detected]
[System Alert: Suppression Efficiency -- 73%]
[System Alert: Baseline Access Limit Maintained -- 23.000%]

I'd buried it, terrified of what it meant. The numbers didn't register as important—just more data tracking my progress.

He leaned in. “I don’t know what it meant by that,” he lied, then gentled it. “Not fully.” He let some truth out with his breath. “I have more light than most. I knew exactly what it meant—too many things. Stronger. Old. I’ve been hiding it because—” He shrugged. “Because people see what they want when they see a kind of power. And what they want isn’t always good for you.”

Liora’s fingers tightened on her cup. “That tracks,” she said, a little too quickly. “There’s more to light than most people think. It can… scar.”

Ralen grunted something like agreement. Brenn nodded once. Sienna’s mouth pressed into a line, thinking around what he hadn’t said.

Ethan kept his hands flat on the table. “I’m not trying to make this about me. Just—if that thing smelled something on me, it wouldn’t be the first time something did.” He almost left it there. Then he added, quiet as he could, “I won’t let it put Mira in more danger.”

It was the last part that changed the air. Sienna’s shoulders softened. Liora’s breath eased. Brenn’s gaze flicked to Ralen and back. Ralen finally looked at Ethan.

“I figured you were more than you let on,” Ralen said. “Didn’t know how much.” He glanced around the hall once, measuring the distance to other ears. “Is there anything you need from us to help you keep it hidden?”

Ethan let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been rationing. “Tell me if you see me slip. If the light looks… wrong. If I look wrong.” He grimaced. “And pull me back.”

Ralen’s mouth quirked. “That last part I can do.”

Sienna nodded. “And we can be loud about it if you need cover.” She lifted her cup a little. “Misdirection is an art.”

Liora drank, then set her cup down with careful reverence, like the promise could be spilled if she wasn’t. Brenn tapped a knuckle against the table in something like a toast.

A faint hum ticked at the edge of Ethan’s awareness—nothing anyone else could hear.

[System Alert: Trust +1 — Pack Cohesion 31%]

He almost smiled. Not because of the number, but because the feeling matched it.

They ate then. Not because food suddenly sounded good, but because the body has rules, and they were all insisting on being followed. Ralen went for seconds and brought back enough for everyone without asking what they wanted. Sienna found the salt and used too much on her portion. Liora scraped gravy from the platter with a finger and looked surprised to find it tasted like anything. Brenn pocketed a roll for later and forgot about it.

When the plates were empty and the noise of the hall had dwindled to a few tired voices, they stood together. No one said, “Let’s get some sleep.” No one had to.

Ethan’s room wasn’t big enough for five people to feel comfortable in, but comfort had already been a lost cause. One narrow bed, a small desk, a trunk at the foot. A single oil lamp turned low. 
The window showed a slice of courtyard and the black-blue line of the sea.

They didn’t even ask whose room we should use. They just followed me in.

They made space the way people do when they’ve been sharing practice yards and benches for years: a little shuffle here, a knee tucked there. Ralen took the chair without argument. Sienna and Liora sat on the floor with their backs to the bed. Brenn leaned against the wall near the door like he could keep the night from stepping in.

“Anyone else’s head feel like a hive?” Sienna asked, not looking up.

Ralen grunted. “Like a drum.”

“Like a loom,” Liora said softly, “with a thread you can’t quite find weaving the wrong pattern through the right one.”

“Like a rock,” Brenn offered, deadpan. Sienna tipped her head toward him, and he lifted one shoulder as if to say it was the only honest answer he had.

They traded what-ifs and should-haves and I-should-have-run-fasters in low voices until the words frayed. Nobody tried to save the night from its own weight. They let it sit with them, heavy and real.

“Did you see Proctor Kane’s face?” Sienna asked after a while. “She looked… not angry. Not even shocked. Like she’d seen a problem she already had a plan for, and the plan was worse than anyone wanted to hear.”

Ethan thought of the way Kane had cut the air with two words and reasserted order, of how the wards had seemed to brighten at the sound of her voice. He remembered her gaze raking the arena once, the way it had lingered on him not as a suspicion but as a math problem she was solving in the margins of something larger.

“She’ll fix the wards,” he said. “That’s what she does.”

“And if she can’t?” Sienna asked.

“Then she’ll make us think she did,” Brenn said, not unkindly.

Liora plucked at the hem of her sleeve. “I don’t think she lies to make us feel better,” she said. “I think she lies to make the work possible.”

Ralen let his head tip back against the chair. “As long as the work gets done.”

Silence again. Ethan let his eyes settle on the oil lamp’s small blue heart. His thoughts circled in tight loops: the demon, the way it had said dragons like a dare, the accidental half-glow he’d caught himself making in the stands when Mira fell, the way he’d crushed it back into his chest because sometimes survival is just refusing to be seen.

He checked the door, the window, the corners. Habit, not paranoia. Then he pulled a blanket from the trunk and flicked it toward the floor with one hand. “Take it,” he said, and meant none of them specifically.

Ralen went still. “You keeping the bed?”

Ethan’s mouth twitched. “It’s my room.”

“Fair.” Ralen stood, dragged the chair closer to the door, and sat again. “I’ll watch. Wake you for second watch, Brenn.”

Brenn’s eyebrows lifted. “We’re doing watches in the safest building in the city?”

Ralen’s eyes closed. “Yes.”

No one argued. Sienna rolled onto her side and tucked her hands under her cheek. Liora curled on the blanket with her satchel under her head like a pillow. Brenn slid down the wall until he was sitting on the floor and tipped his head back.

Ethan doused the lamp and lay down on top of the covers. The room grew soft with night. He kept his eyes open because closing them invited memory too quickly.

Time passed in the way it does when you’re listening to other people breathe: in stretches that feel like you’ve left the clock and come back to it later. At some point, Ralen’s head nodded forward and snapped back up. At some later point, Brenn took his place by the chair without anybody saying a word. Sienna murmured something in her sleep and then stilled. Liora’s breath whistled for three cycles and then smoothed out. Ethan stared into the dark until the dark started to look like the inside of his own eyelids.

He drifted on the edge of sleep and thought—not for the first time—that secrets and fear tasted similar when they rose in the throat.

He tried to imagine telling Sienna and Brenn and Liora everything in the clear light of morning and could not.

He tried to imagine never telling them and could not.

The thoughts tangled, knotted, and then burned out.

It was a relief to stop imagining anything.
He slept for a few hours and woke before the gray at the window turned to blue.
[System Alert: Fatigue Reduced — Focus Restored]
It felt almost honest.
Dawn at the infirmary looked like the night had tried to clean itself up and hadn’t gotten very far. The green ward still burned above the door, but lower. The older healer from last night had been replaced by a different woman with softer edges and a voice that apologized without words as she said, “Two at a time.”

“Two?” Ralen said, like the number had offended him personally.

“Two,” she repeated, and noble or not, stubborn or not, Ralen stepped back from a rule he couldn’t move. “Healers’ orders. And if I so much as see you trying to sneak a third, I will have Proctor Kane herself throw you out.”

Sienna elbowed Liora. “We shouldn’t test her.”

Ralen looked to Ethan. Ethan nodded toward the door. “We’ll go first. We’ll be quick.”

Sienna and Liora would go next. Brenn stopped at the threshold and said quietly, “Tell them my thoughts are with them—but I don’t like infirmaries.” He leaned against the wall to wait, arms folded, eyes on the sea through a window slit.

The corridor inside was bright but not cheerful. Light pooled on clean tile.

We slipped inside, keeping to the far wall.

“Keep voices low,” she said. “And if I put my hand up, you stop mid-sentence and leave. No drama.”

Ralen made a motion with his hands like he was scraping himself thinner to fit the expectation of gentleness. The healer opened the door.
Kaelen lay propped up on a narrow bed that made his legs look too long. Bandages laced his shoulder and ribs; a pale salve painted the skin near his ear where a blade had nicked it. He looked like someone had sketched him in charcoal and then smudged the lines, and his grin—because of course there was a grin—came with enough effort that Ethan could see the price of it.

“Took you long enough,” Kaelen rasped. “I’ve been suffering in here with no entertainment.”

Ralen made a sound that wanted to be a laugh and couldn’t quite manage it. He clasped Kaelen’s forearm carefully to avoid bandages. “Idiot.”

“Correct.” Kaelen’s eyes slid past them, toward the second bed behind a half-curtain. “She’s awake.”

Ethan let his breath out in a slow line.

Mira lay with her head turned toward the window, eyes open. The sunlight catching the thin scar along her ribs made it look like a thread of glass. Her wisp—dim, exhausted—hovered at her shoulder like a candle that refused to admit dawn had already arrived. She didn’t try to sit up when she saw them. She smiled, small and real.

“Hey,” she said.

“Hey,” Ethan answered, and Ralen did too at the same time, and Kaelen did a weak echo just to be included.

Mira’s gaze flicked to Kaelen and stayed. The way she looked at him wasn’t dramatic. It was the look of someone who had counted breaths and found one they didn’t expect to have, and now couldn’t stop counting just in case it disappeared.

“I thought I’d lost you,” she said simply.

Kaelen’s grin faltered. He swallowed. “You’re not allowed,” he said, and then realized he’d aimed that wrong and huffed a laugh. “I’m not allowed. You’re—” He gestured in a small circle that didn’t mean anything and meant everything. “You.”

She blinked hard once. “You,” she returned. The word landed between them like a thing on a table neither of them was ready to pick up and neither of them would let fall.

Ethan looked away because he was supposed to. Ralen looked away because he was kind enough to pretend not to have seen the moment break open.

“How’s the pain?” Ethan asked, directing it toward both of them.

“Which one?” Kaelen said. It should have been flippant. It wasn’t. “Hurts a lot less when you’re in the room.” I looked away again, not because it hurt, but because it didn’t. I was happy for them—sister and brother in everything but name—and the demon had known exactly where to press.

Mira’s mouth curved. “Sentimental.”

“Always,” Kaelen murmured, and meant it.

The healer moved in the corner, making a note on a slate. The scratch of chalk had never sounded so loud.

Ralen found his voice. “Do you remember anything… after…?” He didn’t finish the sentence because finishing it meant naming things the room wasn’t big enough to hold. Ralen’s gaze swept the hall once before he leaned in, shoulders angled to block sightlines.

Mira’s eyes went unfocused for a heartbeat. “Pieces,” she said. “Mostly… holding. And letting go.” Her gaze sharpened. “The demon spoke like it knew exactly which stones to turn in us. I don’t know if it did. Or if it was gambling.”

Kaelen flinched at the word demon without meaning to. “Good gamblers make it look like they’re sure,” he said, paper-dry.

“You scared it,” Ralen said. He didn’t say who he meant.

Mira let her head sink a little further into the pillow. “It wasn’t supposed to be here,” she said. “I told it the truth and made it remember it. That doesn’t make me brave. It makes me… stubborn.”

“That’s another word for brave,” Kaelen said, and Ethan didn’t argue with either of them.

Footsteps clicked in the hall. The healer stepped to the doorway and straightened unconsciously. Valeria Kane paused at the threshold, a line of restraint given shape, and spoke to the healer in words too low to carry. When she glanced in and saw the four of them, her expression didn’t change. Her gaze skimmed over Kaelen and took in his bandages; over Ralen and noted the rigid set of his shoulders; over Mira and softened by almost nothing; over Ethan and paused, half a heartbeat too long.

It wasn’t accusation. It wasn’t approval. It was attention, as if she were memorizing the shape of him against the morning light for comparison later.

“Two minutes,” the healer murmured after Kane moved on. “Not a second more.”

They filled those minutes with the small talk that carries more weight than it should. Sienna and Brenn were waiting outside. Liora had gone to fetch tea. The dining hall had actually managed edible porridge for once. Ralen had snored in a chair without admitting it. Kaelen had tried to charm a strict nurse and failed. Mira had asked for the window to be opened just enough to hear the sea and then slept.

At the edge of it, Kaelen and Mira kept returning to each other. The looks were not grand. They were simply consistent. Like two people who had both been moved one inch closer to a line they didn’t know they were standing on.

Ethan felt something in his chest loosen, not because everything would be fine but because something hard had not happened and he could measure the space it left.

“Time,” the healer said, hand raised.

They obeyed without asking for more.

Outside, Sienna shot to her feet. “Well?”

“Awake,” Ralen said. He rubbed a hand over his face and left it there for a second. “Talking. Being themselves.”

Sienna nodded fast. “Good. Good.” She pressed Liora’s satchel back into her hands as if returning a heart borrowed for a task. “Go. You two.”

Liora didn’t move until Sienna jerked her head toward the door in a way that brooked no objection. “We’ll be here,” Brenn said to Liora and Sienna, which meant something like we’ll be ready if you’re not.

They sat on the bench opposite the infirmary door and let the world come back to them one sense at a time. Someone somewhere laughed, a small sound that didn’t apologize for existing. A bell at a distance counted the hour. A raven landed on the sill and cocked its head, then decided the room didn’t need a prophecy and flew on.

Ethan watched the light creep down the corridor wall. He thought of the demon’s words, of the name it hadn’t said but had circled, of the way Valeria’s gaze had felt like a hand testing the temperature of a flame.

“Going to tell them?” Ralen asked, voice low. No need to specify who them was.

“Not today,” Ethan said. Honesty, if not comfort. “Not yet.”

Ralen accepted that without praise or censure. “Don’t wait until not-yet becomes too late.”

“I won’t,” Ethan said, and meant it as far as he could see.

A healer passed and told them they could step in again—briefly—for the next pair to step out. They didn’t. It wasn’t their turn.

Sienna and Liora came out fifteen minutes later with damp eyes they pretended were from the mint in the air. Liora followed with empty cups and a smile so tentative it felt like the first day after an illness.

“Kaelen asked for a story,” Sienna reported, as if this were a diagnosis. “I told him the one about the goat and the bucket.”

Brenn huffed a laugh. “That old thing? You’ve been torturing people with that since Dawnspire.”

“It worked,” Sienna said, affronted. “Anyway, he laughed.”

“Good,” Ethan said.

Liora fidgeted with her sleeve. “Mira asked… if the wolf came back,” Sienna said quietly.

She picked at the blanket, voice barely audible. “I told her it would. Maybe not today. But it will.”

They didn’t go back in. They could have asked and maybe been allowed another minute. Instead they stood in the corridor until the morning warmed a fraction and their shoulders lowered a little and breath stopped catching like it had to climb stairs to get out.
When they finally turned away, it wasn’t the solemn procession of a night ago. It wasn’t celebration either. It was something in between, human and unfinished.

Outside, the sea threw light against the cliff face as if practicing for noon. The world smelled faintly of salt and tea and the last smoke of a fire that had almost gone out and hadn’t.

Ethan let the sun touch his face. He felt tired in a way sleep wouldn’t fix and steadier in a way no lecture could teach. Near him, Ralen stood very straight and very still, as if the line he kept had been tested and had held. Sienna walked ahead, already arguing with Brenn about whether the goat story had a moral. Liora drifted beside them, eyes on the sky like she was reading a sentence written there in invisible ink.

Behind them, in a bright room full of mint and metal, two beds held two people who had just learned how close the line was between breath and no breath. They had looked at each other and seen that line and chosen, without speeches, to watch it together.

Ethan didn’t look back. He didn’t need to. He carried the image with him: Kaelen’s hand resting on the blanket near Mira’s, not touching; Mira’s wisp pulsing faintly in a rhythm that matched no bell and every heartbeat; the way their eyes had said you and meant I am still here.

He thought that might be what recovery actually was. Not forgetting the ash. Learning how to breathe with it.

[System Alert: Team Cohesion +1 — Progress 32%]

The alert faded like a ripple in clear water. He walked on with his pack, feeling the dawn more than seeing it, knowing it could be enough for today.
