Chapter 15.5 – The Light in the Darkness (Part 2: The Revelation)

Kane led them through the Spire's halls in silence.
Not the Grand Concourse with its marble and crowds, but the upper administrative corridors—narrow, warded, designed to muffle sound and resist scrying. Ethan's boots scraped stone humming with master-level enchantments. The pack moved as one unit, still glowing faintly with residual radiance, their bodies marked by the trial they'd just survived together.
No one spoke. What was there to say?
Ethan had died. Mira's wisp had brought him back. The wards had nearly shattered. And they'd all been seen—every candidate, every scout, every proctor watching as golden light poured from his chest and marked them all.
The secret was out.
His hands still trembled. Every breath felt like dragging air through broken glass. The light in his chest pulsed steadily now—no longer suppressed, no longer fighting him. Just... there. Present. Awake. Impossible to ignore.
He glanced at his pack. Ralen walked close, steady as ever despite the faint golden shimmer on his skin—five years of friendship tested and proven in fire. Kaelen limped beside him, bandaged but grinning weakly, their Dawnspire bond unshakeable. Mira's wisp circled them protectively, her presence a quiet anchor he'd relied on since they were seven years old.
Sienna strode ahead, her flame mark glowing on her wrist, sparks flickering with nervous energy—less than a week since they'd met, but she'd thrown herself into the containment weave without hesitation. Brenn's stone patterns shifted across his shoulders with each step, grounding and solid despite knowing Ethan barely days. Liora's silver runes pulsed at her temple in rhythm with his own heartbeat—a connection forged in desperation, still humming between them.
They'd saved him. All of them. Together.
And now they were walking toward the reckoning.
Kane stopped before an arched doorway carved with sigils that glowed soft gold in the dim corridor. Unlike the administrative oak they'd expected, this entrance was ancient—pre-Aurelian script wound through the frame, pulsing with the same radiant frequency that hummed in Ethan's chest.
She pressed her palm to the center rune. The door recognized her, and swung open silently.
"Inside," she said quietly. "All of you."
The Sunlit Archive.
Ethan had heard of it—every initiate had—but few were ever granted entry. It was the heart of Aurelián's radiant legacy, a library dedicated entirely to the magic his ancestors had wielded before the Great Dimming.
The chamber beyond took his breath away.
Vast and circular, rising three stories toward a domed ceiling inlaid with crystal that caught the afternoon sun and refracted it into a thousand golden beams. The walls were lined floor to ceiling with shelves holding ancient tomes, their spines glowing faintly with preserved radiant sigils. Between the shelves, the stone itself was carved with runes—wards, amplification matrices, binding circles—each one pulsing with dormant power, waiting for someone with the right affinity to wake them.
Floating mana-lamps drifted through the space like small suns, casting warm light across reading tables scattered throughout the room. At the chamber's heart stood a massive circular table, its surface etched with a map of Dravaryn that glowed faintly, each major city marked with a radiant ward-stone that pulsed in sync with the Spire's foundations.
And above the hearth, dominating the far wall, hung the same painting Ethan had glimpsed in his trial's vision: a battle scene showing armored figures wreathed in golden light facing a sky full of wings and fire.
Dragons.
Liora stopped dead in the doorway, her eyes going wide. "This is..." Her voice was barely a whisper. "This is the Sunlit Archive. The repository of pre-Dimming radiant theory." Her gaze darted from the shelves to the carved runes to the glowing tomes, her quill appearing in her hand as if by instinct. "I've read about this place. The wards alone are worth decades of study—"
"Later," Kane said, not unkindly. "Right now, we have more pressing matters."
But Liora was already moving, her fingers tracing the carved script on the doorframe with reverent precision, her analytical mind cataloging every visible sigil. "These are foundation runes. Pre-Aurelian. The binding structure is—" She caught herself, flushing. "Sorry. I just—this is extraordinary."
Sienna nudged her gently. "Breathe, scholar. We'll get you back here."
"Promise?" Liora whispered, still awed.
"Promise," Brenn rumbled.
Highmaster Serath Valthorne stood beside the central table, his crystalline staff resting against its edge. He'd removed his formal outer robes, leaving only the layered under-vestments marked with sigils that pulsed softly in the golden light. His pale eyes tracked each of them as they entered, assessing, measuring.
Kane closed the door. The wards sealed with a sound like a lock turning, and Ethan felt the air thicken—privacy wards, scrying protection, sound dampening. Whatever was said here would stay here.
"Sit," Valthorne said. Not a command. An invitation.
Seven chairs ringed the table—ancient, carved from dark wood, their backs etched with radiant script that glowed faintly as each person took their seat. The pack moved together instinctively: Ralen and Mira flanking Ethan, Kaelen beside Mira, Sienna and Brenn across from them, Liora at Ethan's other side, her fingers immediately tracing the carved runes on her chair's armrest with barely-contained fascination.
Valthorne remained standing. Kane took a position near the hearth, halberd grounded, her scarred face unreadable.
For a long moment, no one spoke. The archive’s lamps drifted lazily overhead, casting shifting shadows across ancient knowledge that suddenly felt less like history and more like prophecy.
Then Valthorne’s gaze settled on Ethan, and the weight of it was like being pinned beneath centuries.
"Ethan Daniels," he said quietly, his voice carrying the depth of years. "Or should I say... Lucien Alaris?"
The name hit like a physical blow.
Sienna's head snapped toward him, eyes wide. Brenn went still as granite. Liora's breath hitched, her quill freezing mid-trace on the armrest.
Ralen's frown deepened, confusion and concern warring in his expression. "Alaris? As in—"
"The royal line," Mira finished softly, her wisp pulsing once with sudden understanding. "The family that wielded radiant magic."
Kaelen let out a low whistle, his usual humor strained. "Well. That's one hell of a secret to keep."
Ethan couldn't speak. His throat had closed, his hands clenched white-knuckled on the table's edge. Five years. Five years of hiding, of building Ethan Daniels into someone safe and unremarkable, of keeping Lucien Alaris buried so deep no one could find him.
Gone. Stripped away in a sentence.
"Alaris?" Sienna's voice was barely above a whisper, sparks flickering nervously along her arms. "The family from the old stories? The ones who fought the—" She stopped, glancing at the painting above the hearth. "—the dragons?"
"A cadet branch," Valthorne said, his tone calm, almost gentle. "But yes. House Alaris. The family that once wielded radiant magic to defend this kingdom. The family whose gift vanished two hundred years ago during the Great Dimming." He paused, letting the words settle. "Until today."
Liora's hand found Ethan's under the table, squeezing once. He didn't pull away, grateful for the anchor.
"I suspected," Valthorne continued, moving slowly around the table, "when Proctor Kane brought me her observations. Anomalous resonance during the trials. Radiant signatures appearing in places they shouldn't. A boy who fought with both blade and magic, but never pushed too hard, never shone too bright." His eyes locked on Ethan again. "A boy who was very, very careful not to be noticed."
Kane's voice cut in from near the hearth. "The wards recognized him. The moment he stepped into the arena, the Spire's foundations woke. Ancient script, dormant for centuries, flared to life." She gestured toward the carved runes on the archive's walls, which pulsed faintly in response. "The same script used when House Alaris first built this place. When they fought the dragons and forged the kingdom's defenses."
Ethan's gaze drifted to the painting. Golden light. Wings and fire. A war no one believed had really happened.
"The dragons," he said hoarsely. "They were real."
Valthorne's expression shifted—something ancient and heavy passing behind his eyes. He walked to the hearth, standing before the painting, his back to them for a long moment.
When he spoke again, his voice carried a weight that made the air feel thick.
"I was there," he said quietly. "The day of Valthor's defeat. When King Thorne Alaris made his decision."
The room went deathly still.
Valthorne turned to face them, and for the first time, Ethan saw the true age in his eyes—not the body of a man in his prime, but the soul of someone who had carried centuries.
"I was twenty-one years old. A lieutenant in the Alaris military, assigned to the King's personal guard during the final campaign against the Dragon Patriarch." His pale eyes grew distant, seeing something none of them could. "The war had raged for generations. Centuries. My grandfather fought. My father fought. I was born into a world where the sky was never truly safe, where every harvest could be ash by dawn, where entire cities vanished beneath dragonfire."
He gestured to the painting. "This is not myth. This is memory. I watched dragons blacken the sky over the Scorched Wastes. I saw them reduce the fortress of Ironhold to molten slag in a single night. Three thousand souls. Gone." His voice remained steady, but something cracked beneath it. "The only thing that held them back was radiant magic. House Alaris, generation after generation, standing as the kingdom's shield. Wards that could turn dragonfire. Light that could pierce their scales. Kings and queens who gave everything to keep the darkness at bay."
He paused, his voice dropping to something almost reverent.
"They called themselves ‘A Light in the Darkness.’ Your family's motto, Lucien. It was not poetry. It was a vow. Every Alaris who bore the radiant gift swore to be the light that held back the night, no matter the cost."
Ethan's chest tightened, the words settling over him like a mantle he wasn't ready to wear.
Mira's wisp had gone very still. Kaelen's grin was long gone, his face pale. Ralen's hands were clenched on the table.
"But even radiant magic had its limits," Valthorne continued. "For every dragon we felled, another rose. For every city we saved, another burned. The toll was..." He paused, searching for words. "Unsustainable. We were winning battles but losing the war. And when Valthor's mate fell during the siege of Ember's Gate, the Patriarch's fury became something beyond reason. He swore that when he died, his heir—a creature even more savage, even less inclined to mercy—would rise and burn the kingdom to bedrock."
Sienna had gone pale. Brenn's stone patterns seemed to dim. Liora's quill had fallen from her grip, forgotten.
"King Thorne Alaris fought Valthor for three days and three nights on the cliffs of the Elder Peaks," Valthorne said, his voice carrying the cadence of a story told too many times to forget. "I was there. I watched radiant magic and dragon fury collide until the very stones wept. And when Thorne finally brought Valthor to his knees—wounded, beaten, moments from death—he did something no one expected."
Valthorne's gaze swept over them, ancient and knowing.
"He offered mercy. Not surrender. Not execution. A pact."
The word hung in the air like a blade.
"Thorne told Valthor: ‘I offer you this—your life, and the lives of your kin, in exchange for eternal exile. You will withdraw to the Elder Peaks. You will never return to these lands. Your kind will be bound by magic, blood, and oath. And in exchange...’” Valthorne's voice dropped. “‘...I will sacrifice my bloodline's gift. The radiant magic that has held you at bay will be sealed away, ensuring neither your kind nor mine can wage this war ever again.’”
Ethan's chest tightened. "He gave up his magic. For peace."
"Not just his," Valthorne said quietly. "Every Alaris. Every heir. Every descendant. The radiant spark that had defined his house for centuries—gone. Traded for the promise that dragons would never darken our skies again."
He paused, his expression heavy.
"Valthor accepted. And I watched as three mages wove the binding: a rune-weaver to craft the structure, a spirit-binder to anchor it, and Thorne himself to provide the radiant sacrifice. The details of the weaving were kept secret—even I do not know the exact structure, only that it required those three disciplines working in perfect harmony."
Liora's analytical mind was working despite the shock. "Three disciplines. That's... that's what we used. Fire, earth, spirit—and the Rune of Connection."
"Similar," Valthorne said, nodding toward her. "But not the same. You instinctively recreated a structure like the Valthor Binding, using the same fundamental principles. But the original pact's precise architecture died with those who forged it. By Thorne's command."
Mira's voice was barely a whisper. "Why keep it secret?"
Valthorne's expression darkened. "Because Thorne knew what his people would say. That he was a coward for not finishing Valthor when he had the chance. That he'd betrayed his duty by surrendering the Alaris gift—the very thing that made his house worthy to rule." His voice grew softer. "He was exhausted. Exhausted from watching his people die, from sending generation after generation into a war that had no end in sight except, perhaps, the eventual defeat of House Alaris itself. He saw the path we were on—slow extinction or pyrrhic victory—and he chose a third way. Sacrifice for survival."
Valthorne's gaze found Ethan again.
"He made me swear never to speak of it. Only one other person would know—my successor, when the time came. The pact would hold in secret, and the kingdom would remember dragons only as myth. A fading story. Something safely in the past."
The weight of two hundred years pressed down on the room.
"And you took his name," Mira said softly, understanding blooming in her eyes. "Valthor. Thorne. Valthorne."
The Highmaster inclined his head. "In honor of both. The dragon who chose survival over vengeance. And the king who chose sacrifice over victory." His expression was solemn. "I vowed that day to preserve the knowledge of what was done. To ensure that if the pact ever faltered, someone would remember the price that was paid—and the stakes if it failed."
"But how are you still alive?" Brenn asked, his practical mind cutting through the emotion.
Valthorne reached into his robes and withdrew a small pendant—a crystalline shard bound in silver, pulsing with faint light that seemed to breathe. "After the binding, I searched. For decades. Following legends of artifacts that could extend a mage's life. I found this in the ruins of the Twilight Sanctum—a fragment of the first radiant ward ever forged, spirit-bound to anchor a soul beyond its natural span." He held it up, the light catching in its facets. "I bound myself to it. A price willingly paid to stand watch over the secret Thorne died to create."
Kane's voice was quiet. "Only I know the truth. And now, you."
The weight of that settled over the room like ash.
Then Valthorne's expression darkened, and the temperature seemed to drop.
"But pacts," he said, each word deliberate, "are only as strong as the parties who consent to them."
He looked at Ethan, and the weight of centuries bore down.
Ethan’s pulse thundered in his ears. The air seemed to retreat, the golden light of the Archive dimming around the edges. Something cold and vast settled in his chest—foreboding and absolute.
"And Valthor is dying."
The silence that followed wasn't quiet.
It was the kind that comes before a scream.
Sienna's face had gone chalk-white, sparks dying completely along her arms. Brenn's hands were shaking—actually shaking—gripping the table hard enough that his knuckles cracked. Liora's quill clattered to the floor, forgotten. Kaelen's crooked grin was gone, replaced by raw, unfiltered fear.
Ralen's voice was hoarse. "Dragons. Real dragons. Coming back."
"Not myths," Mira whispered, her wisp swirling frantically, agitated in a way Ethan had never seen. "Not stories. Real."
"When Valthor dies," Kane said, her tone clinical but her eyes hard, "the binding dissolves. His consent ends. The pact unravels. And every dragon in the Elder Peaks—dozens, maybe hundreds—will be free to return." She paused, her jaw tightening. "At least, that's what we believe. Especially considering recent activity."
"And Dravaryn," Valthorne said quietly, "is utterly unprepared. We have no radiant mages to stand against them. No wards strong enough to hold dragonfire. No living memory of what they're truly capable of." His gaze settled on Ethan, heavy with the weight of history. "Except for you."
Ethan felt the eyes of his pack on him—terrified, desperate, searching for reassurance he couldn't give.
"I didn't ask for this," he said, voice breaking.
"None of us did," Valthorne replied. "But it's here regardless. And your awakening is either the key to restoring the pact..." He paused, and the unspoken truth hung between them like a blade. "...or the spark that shatters it entirely."
His gaze softened slightly, something almost reverent passing through his ancient eyes.
"Perhaps Aeloran brought you to us for this purpose. The old god may yet watch over Dravaryn, even after all these years."
Liora's voice was small, academic precision cracking under the weight of existential dread. "How long? How long until Valthor dies?"
Valthorne and Kane exchanged a glance.
"We don't know," Kane admitted. "Months. Maybe years. But the pact is already fraying. The spirits feel it." She looked at Mira. "You've sensed it, haven't you? The restlessness. The whispers."
Mira nodded slowly, tears streaking down her face. "I thought it was just the trials. But it's been building for weeks. The spirits have been trying to warn me."
Kaelen's voice was hollow. "So what you're saying is... the dragons are coming back. And there's nothing we can do to stop it."
"No," Valthorne said, stepping forward, his staff striking the floor with a resonant chime that cut through the despair. "What I'm saying is that Lucien's radiant awakening is either a disaster—or it's exactly what we need."
He looked at each of them in turn.
"The original pact required a rune-weaver, a spirit-binder, and an Alaris with radiant magic. You three—" His gaze lingered on Liora, then Mira, then Ethan. "—carry those same disciplines. If the pact can be restored, reinforced, or replaced..." He paused. "It will be by you. Together. Just as your ancestors did two centuries ago."
Ralen's hand landed on Ethan's shoulder, heavy and grounding despite the fear in his eyes. "We stand together. That's what we do."
Sienna's sparks reignited, fierce despite the terror. "Dragons or no dragons, we're not letting anyone take him."
Brenn nodded once, solid as stone even as his hands trembled. "The pack holds."
Liora squeezed Ethan's hand under the table, her voice shaking but determined. "We'll figure this out. We always do."
Mira's wisp circled Ethan's head, pulsing with fierce protectiveness. "The spirits chose you. We choose you too."
Kaelen's grin returned, crooked and fragile but there. "Well. This just got very interesting."
Ethan looked at them—at the people who'd stood with him, saved him, and chosen to bind their fates to his in the face of dragons.
"I'm sorry," he said, throat tight. "For lying. For hiding. For dragging you into this."
"Shut up," Sienna said, but her voice was gentle. "You didn't drag us anywhere. We jumped."
Valthorne cleared his throat, drawing their attention back. "The Conclave will arrive within the week. Until then, you will train as a unit under Proctor Kane's direct supervision. You will learn to harness what you forged in that arena—the bond that allowed you to contain radiant magic without burning. And you will prepare for the scrutiny that is coming."
He straightened, his staff pulsing once with authority.
"From this moment forward, you are no longer simply initiates. You are an elite unit of Aurelián Spire, answering directly to me." His pale eyes swept over them, ancient and knowing. "Your trials are complete. Your real work begins now."
Kane stepped forward. "Dismissed. Get food, rest, and meet me in the private training hall at dawn. We have a week to turn you into something the Conclave can't ignore—and something that might survive what's coming."
The pack rose as one, still glowing faintly with residual light, their bond visible even in the Archive's golden glow.
As they filed toward the door, Liora lingered, her eyes darting hungrily toward the shelves lined with radiant knowledge. "Highmaster... may I—"
"Yes," Valthorne said, the ghost of a smile touching his lips. "You may return. This Archive is yours now, Miss Wren. All of you. The knowledge here was meant to be used, not buried."
Liora's face lit up despite everything, and she clutched her notebook like a lifeline. "Thank you. Thank you, I—" Words failed her, but her eyes shone with the kind of hunger only a true scholar understood.
"Go," he said gently. "Rest. Tomorrow, we begin in earnest."
The pack walked back through the warded corridors in quiet thought, but it was a different quiet now.
Not tense. Not broken.
Knowing.																																																			
When they reached the dormitory wing, Sienna threw an arm around Ethan's shoulders, sparks dancing harmlessly along his skin. "So. Lucien Alaris, huh? Destined to fight dragons. That's going to take some getting used to."
"You can still call me Ethan," he said quietly.
"Nah," Kaelen said, his grin a little steadier now. "Lucien fits. Very 'prophesied chosen one' energy."
Brenn rumbled a low chuckle. "We'll workshop it."
Liora fell into step beside him, her silver runes pulsing softly. "For what it's worth... I understand why you hid. And I don't blame you."
Mira's wisp circled them all, weaving threads of connection. "The spirits say you were always meant to shine. You just needed us to help you do it."
Ralen's hand was steady on his shoulder. "Dragons, huh? Guess we'd better get good fast."
Ethan looked at them—at the people who'd stood with him, saved him, and chosen to bind their fates to his even after learning the truth about dragons and dying pacts and the weight of centuries.
"Thank you," he said, voice thick. "For not running."
"Where would we even go?" Sienna said, grinning despite the lingering fear in her eyes. "The light follows you now, Alaris. Might as well stick around for the show."
They reached their corridor, doors glowing faintly with ward-light.
"Dawn training," Ralen said. "Don't be late."
"Wouldn't dream of it," Ethan replied.
As the pack dispersed to their rooms, Ethan stood in the hallway for a moment, watching the faint glow of radiant light still pulsing on his skin.
Marked by Light, the system had said.
A Light in the Darkness, his family had vowed.
Yeah. No hiding now.
He stepped into his room, closed the door, and finally—finally—let himself breathe.

He dismissed the alerts and collapsed onto his bed, staring at the ceiling.
Tomorrow, the real work would begin.
But tonight, for the first time in five years, he didn't have to hide.
The light was out.
And the darkness—dragons and all—would just have to deal with it.
