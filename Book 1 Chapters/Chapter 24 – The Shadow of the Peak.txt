Chapter 24 – The Shadow of the Peaks

Dawn came cold to Aurelián Spire, mist clinging to the marble like something reluctant to let go. The courtyard was nearly empty—just the twelve of them and Valthorne, who stood at the gates with his crystalline staff catching the first pale light.
"The Elder Peaks convergence lies five days northeast," the Highmaster said, his voice carrying the weight of centuries. "Through the Thornwood, across the Ashen Flats, into the mountains themselves. The dragons stir. The world remembers what it's like to fear the sky."
Lucien adjusted the pack across his shoulders, hyperaware of the expanded group. Eleven others. Eight students, Valeria Kane, and three Draemir retainers who watched their master with the nervous alertness of people walking on cracked ice.
No Highmaster.
"You're not coming." It wasn't a question.
Valthorne's expression was carefully neutral. "I cannot."
"The Pact is failing. Valthor is dying. You were there when it was forged—"
"Which is precisely why I cannot go." Valthorne's voice carried quiet pain. "I am bound to the artifact that sustains my life—the shard of the first radiant ward. It anchors me to Aurelián. I can no more leave the Spire's foundation than you could leave your own bones."
He gestured to the crystalline staff. "This is no ornament. It is tether. Step beyond the Spire's ward-radius, and the binding that keeps me alive unravels. I would have perhaps hours before…"
He didn't finish.
"Then send someone else," Mira said. "Another master. Someone who—"
"No." Valthorne's tone was final. "You are the Sevenfold plus its guardians. The ritual demands those who understand the framework—who built it, tested it, who carry the disciplines in their bones. Additional masters would destabilize the balance."
He looked at each of them in turn. "Radiance. Shadeweave. Rune. Flame. Earth. Spirit. And Valeria to guard you all." His gaze settled on Tharion. "Plus one who carries knowledge of the original Pact's structure and can navigate what Shade was used for—and what it should never be used for again."
Tharion stood slightly apart from the others, black-and-silver robes immaculate despite the early hour. Gavren, Selara, and Veyric waited behind him—his retainers, his shadows, his house's last desperate grasp at relevance.
Valthorne's voice softened. "I wish I could walk this path with you. But some prices were paid long ago, and the debt comes due in strange ways." He straightened. "Valeria will lead. Trust her. Trust each other. And remember—the Sevenfold works because no single thread dominates. You are equals in this."
Lucien wanted to protest. Wanted to demand the Highmaster find a way. But he saw the truth in Valthorne's eyes: the man who had named himself for a dragon and a king, who had bound his life to an artifact to guard a secret for two centuries, had already sacrificed everything he could.
"We'll make it work," Lucien said quietly.
Valthorne's hand found his shoulder. "I know you will."
They left through the eastern gate as the sun broke fully over the horizon.
The road northeast was well-traveled in peacetime—merchants, pilgrims, the occasional military patrol. Now it felt abandoned. Villages they passed were shuttered, livestock driven indoors, faces peering nervously from windows at the sky.
They made good time despite the tension. Valeria set a pace that ate miles without exhausting them, stopping briefly at midday for food and water. Tharion walked near the rear of the formation, his three retainers flanking him like nervous shadows. Gavren kept glancing at the sky. Selara's hand never strayed far from her dagger. Veyric muttered calculations under his breath, mapping their route obsessively.
"They're scared," Kaelen observed quietly, falling into step beside Lucien.
"Can you blame them?" Lucien replied. "Dragons. Failing Pacts. The world ending."
"No. I mean they're scared of him." Kaelen nodded toward Tharion. "Watch how they move. They're not following him. They're avoiding his displeasure."
Lucien watched. Kaelen was right. Every time Tharion's gaze swept their direction, all three flinched.
"House Draemir isn't kind to failure," Liora murmured, joining them. "And after Gavren's coin incident during the trials… Tharion has every right to be furious."
"But he hasn't dismissed them," Mira added. "They're still here."
"For now," Sienna said darkly.
By dusk, they reached the forest's edge. The Thornwood loomed ahead, ancient oaks stretching toward a sky already dimming to violet.
Valeria called halt at a defensible clearing. "We camp here. Enter the Thornwood at first light. Watch rotation: Ralen and Brenn first, Kaelen and Sienna second, myself and Tharion third."
As the others set to making camp, Tharion approached his retainers. His voice carried just far enough for Lucien to hear.
"Gavren. Selara. Veyric. Come."
They followed him beyond the firelight, to where shadow pooled beneath the trees. For a long moment, Tharion said nothing. Just studied them—three young Shadeweavers who had tied their futures to a house in decline, who had remained even after scandal.
I've seen the patterns, Tharion thought. The Conclave members who close ranks when questions are asked. The investigations that disappear. The convenient accidents that silence those who dig too deep. My father's 'accident' that was sealed in the records before anyone could ask why. Something is rotting at the heart of the kingdom's magical authority. And when I return from the Elder Peaks, I'm going to find out what. But if these three know what I'm planning and refuse to help... they could report me. Warn whoever's pulling the strings. I'd be dead before I uncovered a single piece of evidence. My death or theirs. Simple equation.
His hand drifted unconsciously to the knife at his belt, then stilled. Eight people would notice. Eight people who already know something's wrong with the Conclave. The Pack would ask questions.
So maybe... maybe I just ask. See if they choose me.
"You threw the coin," Tharion said to Gavren. No question. Statement.
Gavren's face went pale. "My lord, I—"
"You nearly killed Kaelen Thorne. You destabilized wards that protected hundreds. You acted without authorization and brought shame to our house." Tharion's voice was ice. "Give me one reason I shouldn't send you back to Draemhold in disgrace."
Silence. Gavren's throat worked. "I... I have none, my lord."
"Good." Tharion's shadows coiled tighter. "Because there isn't one. What you did was unforgivable."
He turned to Selara and Veyric. "And you two knew. I saw it in your faces after. You knew what he planned and said nothing."
Selara's voice was barely above a whisper. "We thought... we thought it would help. That if Thorne failed, your victory would be unquestioned."
"My victory." Tharion laughed, bitter and sharp. "You thought sabotaging a trial would bring me victory? As if House Draemir's reputation could sink any lower than 'the house that cheats'?"
He stepped closer. "Do you know what my mother told me before she died?" His voice dropped. "She said, 'Your father reached for the light and it burned our house. Don't repeat his mistakes.'"
They called it an accident. But accidents don't erase research logs. Don't silence witnesses. Something deeper killed him.
"Every day since, I've tried to rebuild what he destroyed. To prove we're more than our worst moment. And you three nearly undid twelve years of work in twelve seconds."
Veyric's voice was small. "We're sorry, my lord."
"I don't want your apologies." Tharion's shadows began to dissipate. "I want your help."
They looked up, confused.
This is the moment, Tharion thought. Either they choose me, or I deal with the consequences later.
"The Conclave is corrupted," Tharion said quietly. "I don't know how deep it goes. I don't know who's involved. But I've seen too many convenient accidents. Too many investigations that disappear. Too many people who ask questions and suddenly stop asking." His eyes hardened. "My father's death was ruled an accident, but I've seen the reports. The containment wards failed exactly the same way a Conclave experiment failed two months later—quietly buried. I think someone used him as a test and erased the evidence."
He let the words hang in the air.
"When I return from the Elder Peaks—if I return—I'm going to investigate. I'm going to find out who's pulling strings, who's taking bribes, how deep the rot goes." His voice was steady. "And I need help. People I can trust. People who won't run to the Conclave the moment things get dangerous."
"So I'm giving you a choice. Return to Draemhold now. Find positions elsewhere, away from whatever storm is coming." He met each of their eyes. "Or stay. Help me dig into the Conclave. Help me find the truth. And when we do, stand with House Draemir as it either redeems itself or falls trying."
Please choose me, he thought. Not out of fear. Because you actually want to.
Gavren spoke first, voice shaking but steady. "I threw the coin because I thought winning mattered more than honor. I was wrong." He straightened. "If the Conclave is corrupt... if they're the reason our house has been buried for two decades... then I want to know. I'm with you."
Selara's voice was quiet. "My mother served the Conclave for twenty years. Died believing it was just and fair." Her eyes hardened. "If she died serving a lie... then I want them to answer for it. I'm with you."
Veyric studied Tharion for a long moment, calculating. Then nodded. "You're asking us to risk everything on a suspicion. But you're also the first Draemir lord in my lifetime who's tried to rebuild instead of just survive." His voice firmed. "House Draemir falls or rises. We fall or rise with it."
Tharion's hand left the knife. The tension in his shoulders eased. They chose. Because they wanted to.
Something in his chest—tight and cold for so long—loosened slightly. "Then we do this right," he said. "When we return, we investigate carefully. Document everything. Find proof that can't be dismissed or buried." His voice softened slightly. "We reclaim our honor through truth. Even if truth is the hardest path."
"Yes, my lord."
"Go. Get some rest. Tomorrow, the Thornwood."
They left. Tharion remained in the shadows a moment longer, hands trembling. I would have killed them, he realized. If they'd refused and tried to report me. The equation was simple.
But they didn't refuse. They chose me. Not because I threatened them. Because they believe in what we're trying to do. Maybe that's what Mother meant. Maybe that's the difference.
When he returned to the firelight, Lucien caught his eye. A brief nod passed between them—not friendship, but understanding. Two boys trying to be better than their legacies.
The next morning, they entered the Thornwood.
Ancient oaks stretched overhead, their branches weaving shadows thick enough to taste. The forest had always been wild, but now it felt restless—birds silent, undergrowth too still, the air carrying a tension that made Ralen's hand drift unconsciously to his axe.
"Something's wrong," Mira whispered, her wisp flickering nervously at her shoulder.
"Everything's wrong," Kaelen muttered. "Dragons flying. Gods stealing souls. The world's gone mad."
Sienna shot him a look. "Not helping."
"I'm not trying to help. I'm trying to stay sane."
Liora's eyes tracked the canopy, cataloging patterns. "The displacement is worse than predicted. Normal migration routes would take weeks. This... this is panic."
Brenn's voice was low. "Then we move fast and quiet."
They pushed deeper, Valeria taking point with practiced efficiency. The formation had expanded to accommodate twelve—Valeria and Tharion at front and rear, the core Pack in the middle, Draemir retainers flanking. Gavren's shadows extended outward, reading the darkness between trees. Selara walked with daggers drawn, eyes scanning. Veyric muttered calculations, tracking their position obsessively.
They'd chosen Tharion. Now they had to prove it was the right choice.
The attack came at sunset.
They'd found a clearing Valeria deemed defensible—rocky outcrop at their backs, clear sightlines. Brenn was reinforcing the perimeter with earth-forged wards when the forest erupted.
Not wolves. Not bears. Wyverns.
Smaller than true dragons but no less vicious—scaled serpents with batlike wings and venom that could drop a horse in seconds. They shouldn't have been this far south. Shouldn't have been hunting in packs.
But there were eight of them.
They hit from above, talons extended, screeching fury that shattered the twilight calm.
"FORMATION!" Valeria's voice cut through chaos.
They moved like she'd drilled them—muscle memory overriding panic.
Brenn front, earth walls erupting to catch the first diving strike. Stone cracked under impact but held. Ralen right flank, axe singing as he intercepted a wyvern trying to flank. The creature's head separated from its body in a spray of dark blood.
Kaelen vanished, reappearing behind another wyvern to drive twin daggers through its wings. It crashed, shrieking, and Sienna's flames consumed it before it could recover. Mira's wisp expanded into a shimmering barrier, deflecting venom that hissed where it struck stone.
Liora's runes flared—containment sigils that slowed the creatures' movements, made them predictable. Tharion's shadows wrapped around two diving wyverns simultaneously, not attacking but disorienting—bending light around them until the creatures couldn't tell up from down. They slammed into trees, stunned.
Gavren was there in an instant, his own shadows forming blade-like extensions that pierced through one wyvern's exposed throat. Not elegant, but effective. Selara moved like water, daggers finding the gaps in scales as a third wyvern tried to recover. It died thrashing, venom spraying harmlessly against her shadow-shield.
Veyric's shadows weren't combat-trained, but he'd studied warding. His containment field caught a wyvern mid-dive, holding it suspended long enough for Valeria's halberd to separate head from body.
And Lucien—
Radiant light erupted from his hands, not the careful controlled bursts he'd used before but full power—golden fire that seared through scales and sent two wyverns spiraling into the trees, smoking.
Too much power. Too easy. Is this what you wanted, Aeloran? he thought bitterly. A weapon that doesn't question?
"LUCIEN! LEFT!"
Sienna's warning came half a second too late. The eighth wyvern—larger than the others, scarred and ancient—hit him from the side, talons raking across his shoulder, venom burning like liquid fire. He went down hard, vision blurring.
Through the bond, the Pack felt it—his pain, their fury. Brenn was there first, hammer crushing the wyvern's wing joint. Mira's wisp poured healing light into the wound, neutralizing venom before it reached his heart. Ralen and Kaelen formed a wall between him and the thrashing creature.
Tharion's shadows wrapped around its head, blinding it completely. "NOW!"
Gavren, Selara, and Veyric struck as one—three Shadeweavers working in perfect synchronization. Their combined shadows drove through the creature's chest like spears, finding the heart. It died with a final shriek.
Valeria's halberd took its head anyway. "Confirm your kills."
Then silence.
Just ragged breathing and the crackle of dying flames.
"Report," Valeria said, voice steady despite the blood on her armor.
"Lucien's poisoned but stable," Mira said, hands still glowing. "I've got it. He'll be fine."
"Minor cuts. Nothing serious," Ralen reported.
"Same," Kaelen added.
"Burned through too much mana," Sienna said, slumping against a tree. "Need to rest."
"Wards held but cracked in three places. I can reinforce," Liora said.
Tharion looked at his three retainers. Gavren's shoulder was bleeding. Selara was breathing hard, shadows flickering with exhaustion. Veyric's containment had cost him—his hands shook slightly. But they'd fought. Really fought.
"Draemir unit reports functional," Tharion said. "Minor injuries. Combat-capable."
Something passed through Valeria's expression—approval, maybe. Recognition.
"Good. Brenn, reinforce those wards. Everyone else, tend wounds and salvage what you can. We move at first light."
They set to work—twelve people who'd been strangers weeks ago, now moving with the efficiency of a unit that had bled together.
Lucien sat with his back against stone, shoulder bandaged, watching them work. Gavren approached hesitantly. "Lord Alaris. I..." He swallowed. "I owe you an apology. For the coin. For Thorne's trial. I nearly killed your friend through my arrogance."
Lucien studied him. Saw genuine regret, not political maneuvering.
"You threw the coin. You own that. But you also just helped save my life." He gestured to the dead wyvern. "So we're even. For now."
"Thank you, my lord."
"Don't call me that. Just... Lucien."
Gavren nodded and withdrew. Ralen settled beside Lucien, axe across his knees. "They fought well. The Draemir trio."
"Yeah." Lucien's voice was quiet. "They did."
"Stop apologizing through the bond," Ralen added. "I can still feel it. You're drowning in guilt."
"I lied to all of you."
"You didn't know."
"I should have—"
"Should have what? Guessed you were a stolen soul?" Ralen's tone wasn't cruel, just blunt. "You're not a god. You're just a person trying to survive something impossible."
"But—"
"No." Ralen's hand found his shoulder—the uninjured one. "You're our pack. That hasn't changed. The rest... we'll figure it out. Together."
Lucien's throat closed. He nodded, not trusting his voice.
Across the camp, Tharion watched Gavren, Selara, and Veyric tending each other's wounds. Working together. Trusting each other. They chose me, he thought. Not because they had to. Because they wanted to. Maybe that's enough.
They slept in shifts, and the night passed without incident.
By the next afternoon, they left the Thornwood behind, the terrain opening into rolling hills that offered easier travel but more exposure. The expanded group had found its rhythm. Valeria and Tharion anchored front and rear. The Pack maintained the core. The Draemir retainers rotated through scouting positions, their shadow-sense reading the land ahead.
"Movement," Gavren called from the eastern flank. "Four hundred yards. Too large for deer."
Valeria's hand went to her halberd. "Formation."
They moved smoothly now, twelve people flowing into defensive positions without hesitation. The movement resolved into travelers—a merchant caravan, six wagons heading west away from the mountains. Away from the dragons.
"Refugees," Liora said quietly. "The displacement is accelerating."
The merchants gave them wide berth, eyes fearful. One old woman made a warding sign as they passed.
"She thinks we're going to die," Kaelen observed.
"She's probably right," Veyric muttered.
"Cheerful," Sienna said, but her flames flickered nervously.
That evening, as they set camp, Selara approached the main group—hesitant, uncertain. "May I..." She gestured to the fire. "May I sit?"
Mira smiled gently. "Of course."
Selara settled, careful to keep distance. "I wanted to apologize. For the coin. For Gavren. For... all of it."
"You didn't throw it," Kaelen pointed out.
"No. But I didn't stop him either." Her voice was quiet. "I thought House Draemir's honor mattered more than the trials' integrity. I was wrong."
"Why the change of heart?" Liora asked, not unkindly.
Selara's gaze drifted to where Tharion stood with Veyric, reviewing maps. "Because he's trying to be better than his house's legacy. And if he can do that..." She met their eyes. "Maybe we can too."
Ralen nodded slowly. "Apology accepted. But earn it."
"I will."
She returned to the Draemir camp, and the group sat in thoughtful silence.
"This is strange," Kaelen said finally. "All of us. Working together. Houses that have hated each other for generations."
"Maybe that's the point," Brenn rumbled. "The old Pact was built by enemies forced together. Maybe the new one works because we're choosing it."
That night, under stars that seemed closer in the open land, twelve people from different houses, different histories, different wounds, slept in shifts. And for the first time, it felt less like an alliance of necessity and more like something that might endure.
By the next day, they reached the Ashen Flats—miles of cracked earth and sulfur vents, the ground itself remembering when dragons had scorched it to glass. Nothing grew here. Nothing lived here.
"I don't like this," Sienna muttered, flames dancing nervously along her arms. "Too open. Too quiet."
"Agreed," Valeria said. "We cross fast. No stops unless absolutely—"
The ground erupted.
Not wyverns this time. Ash Wurms.
Massive serpentine creatures that burrowed through volcanic soil, drawn to heat and movement. They'd been dormant for decades, driven deeper by the absence of dragon activity. Now, with dragons stirring, they were rising.
Five of them, each one fifty feet long, scaled in obsidian, mouths ringed with teeth that could grind stone to powder.
"FORMATION!" Valeria's command was instant.
Twelve people moved as one.
Brenn front, earth walls erupting. But the wurms were built for breaking stone—the first barrier shattered under impact.
"SECOND LINE!" Valeria's halberd caught the lead wurm's lunge, deflecting it just enough. Ralen was there, axe biting deep, berserker rage flooding his veins as he carved through obsidian hide. Behind him, Gavren's shadows wrapped the wound, preventing regeneration.
A second wurm surfaced behind them. Kaelen vanished and reappeared on its back, daggers seeking vulnerable points. Veyric's containment field locked the creature in place long enough for Kaelen to find the gap between skull-plates and drive both blades home.
The third wurm targeted the mages. Liora's runes created a maze of barriers, slowing it. Sienna poured flame into every gap, superheating obsidian scales until they cracked. Selara moved through the chaos like smoke, daggers finding the cracks Sienna created, driving deep.
Mira's spirits harassed the fourth wurm, distracting it from Brenn's defense. When it lunged for her, Tharion's shadows caught it mid-strike—not stopping it, but confusing its senses enough that it struck stone instead of flesh.
Lucien stood at the center, radiant light pouring outward. He reinforced Brenn's barriers, amplified Sienna's flames, wove golden threads through Liora's runes to make them unbreakable.
The Sevenfold in practice—seven disciplines plus five defenders working as one organism.
The first wurm fell to Ralen and Gavren's combined assault, its head cleaved and its regeneration sealed. The second died to Kaelen and Veyric, daggers and shadows in brutal efficiency. The third burned under Sienna and Selara's coordination, flame and blade in perfect synchronization. The fourth tried to burrow, to escape, but Brenn turned soil to stone around it, trapping it while Mira's spirits crushed its core and Tharion's shadows smothered its final strike.
The fifth, seeing its kin fall, dove deep, trying to flee. Lucien wouldn't let it. Radiant light flooded the ground, following the creature's path. Where his power touched, stone turned molten. The wurm's scream was cut short as it cooked in its own tunnel.
Then silence.
Twelve people stood breathing hard in the aftermath, covered in ash and blood and obsidian dust.
"Casualties?" Valeria's voice was steady despite being drenched in wurm-blood.
"None serious," Tharion reported. "Exhaustion. Minor burns. Gavren's shoulder wound reopened."
"Mend what you can. We move in ten minutes," Valeria ordered. "More will come if we stay."
They moved fast, leaving the killing ground behind. Brenn fell into step beside Tharion. "Your people fought well."
"They're learning," Tharion said. "Still rough. Still making mistakes. But learning."
"That's all any of us can do."
By dusk, the mountains rose ahead like teeth against the sky.
At dawn, a ranger found them—Aurelián scout, by the silver cloak and the desperation in his eyes. His horse was lathered, near collapse, foam flecking its mouth.
"Proctor Kane," he gasped, nearly falling from the saddle. "Message from the Spire. Dragon attack. Western territories."
Lucien's blood froze.
"Where?" Valeria demanded, catching the ranger before he collapsed.
"Southern Alaris holdings. Lord Theron's ancestral estates." The ranger's voice shook. "Bronze scales. Massive wingspan. The reports—" He swallowed hard. "The creature circled the main house three times. Breathing fire."
The world tilted.
"My parents—" Lucien couldn't finish.
"The estate is burning," the ranger continued. "The barns. The outer buildings. The dragon set them ablaze deliberately, methodically. Then it..." His eyes found the peaks. "Then it flew northeast. Toward here."
Through the bond, the Pack felt Lucien's terror. His helplessness. The crushing weight of being five days from home when everything might already be ash.
Mira's hand found his arm. "We don't know they're—"
"Don't." His voice broke. "Don't tell me we don't know. Three passes. Breathing fire. The house is burning."
Valeria's voice cut through. "Did the runner report casualties?"
The ranger hesitated, and that pause was worse than any words.
"Speak," Valeria commanded.
"The runner left before... before he could confirm." The ranger's hands shook. "Lord Theron and Lady Sera were organizing evacuation when the dragon made its third pass. The fire was spreading fast. He saw them heading toward the old stone vaults beneath the house—the ones that might withstand dragonfire." His voice dropped. "But whether they made it inside before the structure collapsed... he didn't know."
Lucien took a step toward the path down. Toward home. Toward parents who might already be dead.
Valeria's hand caught his shoulder. "We're two days from the convergence. Turning back means—"
"Means my parents could be dead while I'm climbing a mountain." His voice was raw.
"Or they could be alive in those vaults, and turning back dooms everyone." Valeria's tone was iron. "Including them. If the Pact fails completely, nowhere is safe. Not the vaults. Not the Spire. Nowhere."
"She's right," Ralen said quietly, though his own voice shook. "If the Pact shatters, the dragons won't stop at one estate."
"I can't—" Lucien's chest was tight. "I can't just leave them—"
"They're not asking you to leave them," Liora said softly. "They're asking you to save them. By finishing this."
"You don't know that."
"I do." Her eyes were steady. "Because that's what parents do. They want their children to survive. Even when it costs them everything."
Through the bond, Sienna's grief echoed his own. Kaelen's helpless fury. Mira's quiet desperation. Brenn's solid presence trying to hold them all steady. Even Tharion's carefully controlled pain—he understood what it meant to lose parents, to carry their weight.
The ranger cleared his throat. "Proctor. There's more. The dragon..." He hesitated.
"Speak," Valeria commanded.
"The scouts said..." The ranger's hands were shaking. "They said it looked like it was looking for something. Each pass, it circled lower over the main house. Like it was searching. Or..." His eyes found Lucien. "Or sending a message."
A chill ran down Lucien's spine.
"It knows," Tharion said quietly. "Knows who you are. Knows you're coming."
Valeria's jaw tightened. "Then the convergence is no longer secret. Whatever we face there, we face it knowing we're expected." She looked at the ranger. "Return to the Spire. Tell Valthorne we're proceeding. And tell him..." She paused. "Tell him to send every available warden to the Alaris estates. Reinforcements. Healers. Whatever it takes."
"Yes, Proctor." The ranger remounted his exhausted horse and turned south.
Lucien stood frozen, torn between the mountain ahead and the burning home behind. Twelve people waited. Not pushing. Not pulling. Just... there.
Finally, Mira's wisp brushed his cheek, warm and gentle. "We finish this. For them. For everyone."
He closed his eyes. Breathed through the terror. The guilt. The crushing knowledge that he was choosing the world over his parents.
They raised me for twelve years, he thought. Loved someone they thought was their son. They deserve to know I'm not him. To choose whether they still want me after. I can't do that if I'm dead. Or if the world burns.
"Let's go," he said, voice hollow.
They climbed.
The path to the convergence wound through ice and stone, each step bringing them closer to Valthor, to the Sevenfold's test, to whatever waited in the dragon's lair.
Above them, circling the highest peak, a bronze dragon waited. Not attacking. Just watching.
Twelve people walked together into the mountain's heart—eight students, one master warrior, three retainers who'd chosen loyalty because they believed in what they were building. Bound by choice, by necessity, by the stubborn refusal to break under the weight of what they carried.
Lucien looked at them—his Pack, his allies, his family built from choice rather than blood.
"Whatever happens in there," he said quietly, "thank you. For choosing this. For choosing me. Even knowing what I am."
"Always," Mira said simply.
Behind them, smoke rose from the western territories. Ahead, something ancient and cruel waited to see if mercy had made them weak.
And above, the bronze dragon followed—patient, inexorable, marking their every step.
The convergence was close now. One more day. One more day until everything changed.
