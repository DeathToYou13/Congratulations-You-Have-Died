The Goat and the Bucket
There was once a farmer who had a goat. Stubborn thing. Wouldn't listen to reason, wouldn't follow orders, wouldn't do a single useful thing except eat everything in sight.
One day, the farmer leaves a bucket by the well. Just a bucket. Perfectly innocent.
The goat sees it, walks over, sticks its entire head inside, and gets stuck.
Now, a smart goat would back up. Pull its head out. Move on with its life.
This goat? Panics. Starts running. Bucket still on its head. Can't see where it's going, just charging blind across the yard, smashing into fences, tripping over chickens, knocking down the magistrate's laundry line—his best formal robes go straight into the mud.
The farmer chases it. The neighbors chase it. The village children think it's the funniest thing they've ever seen and start following like it's a parade.
The goat crashes through the baker's stall—flour everywhere, loaves flying. Tramples the herbalist's drying racks—medicinal herbs scattered to the four winds. Somehow ends up in the village square during market day, knocking over three merchants' carts and a ceremonial display the village elder had just finished arranging for the harvest festival.
The elder loses his mind. Starts shouting about order and dignity and "this is why we can't have nice things." Sends a runner to fetch the lord's guard because clearly this is a threat to public safety.
Six guardsmen. Full armor. Spears. Chasing one goat with a bucket on its head.
They corner it by the well. The captain draws his sword—not to hurt it, just to look authoritative—and the goat, in a final moment of panic, throws itself backward into the well.
Splash.
Bucket comes off. Goat climbs out soaking wet, looks at the entire assembled village—farmer, guards, elder, merchants, traumatized chickens—and walks away like nothing happened.
The guard captain writes a full incident report. Three pages. The elder frames it. Hangs it in his office.
Next morning?
Same goat. Same bucket. Sticks its head right back in.
The Moral
"Never underestimate how much chaos one idiot with confidence can cause."

The Goat and the Bucket
As told by Sienna, in the infirmary
The infirmary was quiet, except for the faint hum of healing wards and the soft rain drops against the windows. Mira was awake but pale, her arm still bandaged and her wisp hovering close, dim but steady. Kaelen sat half upright, face drawn but defiant, wrapped from shoulder to ribs.
Liora sat nearby with her notes closed for once, the faint scent of mint from the poultices clinging to her sleeves.
Sienna broke the silence with a grin that didn’t quite hide the worry behind it. “Alright,” she said, looking between them. “You two look miserable. Want to hear a story?”
Kaelen groaned. “If it’s another tactical lesson disguised as a fable, I’ll—”
“It’s not.” Sienna raised a hand. “This one’s about a goat.”
Mira blinked. “A goat?”
“Mm-hmm. And a bucket.”
Liora looked up from where she’d been fussing with a teacup. “This sounds educational already.”
Sienna smirked. “Oh, it is. So—there was once a farmer with a goat. Stubborn thing. Wouldn’t listen, wouldn’t help, wouldn’t do anything useful except eat everything it shouldn’t. One day, the farmer leaves a bucket by the well. Just a bucket. Perfectly innocent.”
She leaned forward, hands moving as she spoke. “The goat sees it. Walks over. Sticks its head inside. Gets stuck.”
Kaelen winced, then smirked. “Tragic.”
“Tragic doesn’t cover it,” Sienna said. “Now, any reasonable creature would back up, shake it off, move on. But this goat? No. It panics. Takes off running—bucket still on its head—blind as a bat. Smashes through fences, tramples chickens, knocks over the magistrate’s laundry line—his best robes, mind you—right into the mud.”
Mira’s lips curved faintly. “Oh no.”
“Oh yes,” Sienna said. “The farmer chases it, neighbors join in, and half the village kids start following like it’s a parade. Goat barrels through the baker’s stall—flour everywhere, loaves flying. The air’s white as snow. Then it tramples the herbalist’s drying racks—scatters herbs so bad the whole street smells like a tea shop explosion. Even the chickens are sneezing.”
Kaelen laughed, then immediately winced, clutching his side. “Ow—keep going, though.”
Sienna tried not to smile too wide. “So by now, the elder’s losing his mind. He’s shouting about order and dignity and—‘this is why we can’t have nice things!’ He calls the guard. Six of them. Full armor. Spears. To catch one goat.”
Liora set her teacup down, eyes twinkling. “Please tell me they failed.”
“Oh, they absolutely failed,” Sienna said. “They corner it by the well. The captain pulls his sword just to look impressive. And the goat—swear on Ralen’s axe—throws itself backward into the well. Splash. Bucket comes off. Goat climbs out, dripping wet, looks at everyone—the guards, the elder, the chickens—and just walks away.”
Mira was laughing now, softly but fully, her wisp flickering with each breath. “That can’t be true.”
“It’s absolutely true,” Sienna said with mock solemnity. “The guard captain even wrote a report about it. Three pages long. The elder framed it in the town hall.”
Liora tilted her head, smiling faintly. “Let me guess. The goat came back the next day.”
Sienna grinned. “Same goat. Same bucket.”
Kaelen groaned with laughter, his eyes half-closed but bright. “You’re making that up.”
“Maybe,” Sienna said, shrugging. “But it makes a good point.”
Mira smiled, tired but warm. “Which is?”
Sienna hesitated, then said lightly, “Sometimes you get stuck in the same bucket twice. Doesn’t mean you stop running.”
Liora sipped her tea. “That’s either profound or terrible advice.”
“Both,” Sienna said. “That’s what makes it good.”
Kaelen sank back into his pillows, chuckling under his breath. “Remind me never to let you near a bucket.”
Mira’s laugh was soft but steady. “You wouldn’t stop her anyway.”
Sienna shrugged, a spark of pride in her eyes. “Probably not.”
Liora closed her notebook, watching the three of them with quiet fondness. “Well,” she murmured, “if the goat could survive all that chaos, I think we’ll manage too.”
No one argued.
The rain kept tapping the window. The ward-lights dimmed. And for the first time since the trial, the infirmary felt almost peaceful.
