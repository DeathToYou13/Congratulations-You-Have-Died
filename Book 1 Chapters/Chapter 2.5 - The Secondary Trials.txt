Chapter 2.5 – The Secondary Trials

The Secondary Academy Trials were different from the entrance exams we'd taken at seven.
Those had been simple—can you hold a practice sword? Can you feel mana at all? Do you understand basic letters?
These were spectacles. Personalized gauntlets crafted to unearth hidden talents, designed to make candidates shine like beacons for the kingdom's elite institutions.
Everyone knew the stakes. Pass well enough, and letters arrived from academies across Dravaryn. Pass exceptionally, and Aurelián Spire Academy might notice you.
I'd been working toward this moment for five years.
Five years of being Ethan Daniels. Five years of practicing the performance until the mask fit so well I sometimes forgot which name belonged to which face.
But today wasn't just about me.
My pack stood together in Dawnspire's training yard as dawn broke over the stone walls, two hundred candidates assembled and waiting. Ralen rolled his shoulders, already loosening up. Mira's spirit wisp pulsed steadily at her shoulder—outwardly calm, but I caught the tension in her jaw. Kaelen bounced on his toes, restless energy barely contained.
We'd trained together for five years. Sparred together. Bled together.
Now we'd prove ourselves together.
Headmaster Vorn's voice cut through the morning air, commanding without volume. "The Secondary Trials are revelations. Each of you will face challenges designed for your strengths, your weaknesses, your potential. You cannot hide what you are. You can only show us what you've become."
I felt those words in my chest like a warning.
Cannot hide what you are.
Except I'd spent five years doing exactly that.

Ralen's Trial
They called Ralen first.
The yard's wards hummed, reshaping the training ground into something brutal—a packed earth arena studded with stone pillars and scattered with obstacles. Five massive golems rose from the ground, each one carved from solid rock, twice Ralen's height and built for destruction.
"Begin," the proctor commanded.
Ralen didn't hesitate.
The first golem charged. Ralen met it head-on, battleaxe swinging in a controlled arc that his clan had drilled into him since childhood. Not wild berserker fury—disciplined power, rage given purpose and direction.
The impact rang like a bell. Stone cracked. The golem's arm shattered at the shoulder.
Ralen pivoted, already moving to the next target. His movements were economical, efficient. Each strike measured. Each dodge calculated. The controlled fury of a warrior who'd learned that strength without discipline was just noise.
A golem's fist caught him in the ribs. I heard the impact from the sidelines, saw him stagger. Blood on his lip. But he rolled with it, came up swinging, and drove his axe through the construct's knee joint.
It collapsed.
Three more to go.
We watched in tense silence—Mira's wisp pulsing anxiously, Kaelen leaning forward like he could will Ralen faster. I kept my hands still on the railing, very aware of the Radiance flickering in my chest, wanting to surge in sympathetic response to my friend's struggle.
I locked it down.
Ralen took a hit to the shoulder that would have dropped most candidates. He grunted, adjusted his grip, and kept fighting. Blood ran down his arm, soaked into his tunic. But his eyes stayed clear, focused.
The fourth golem fell.
The fifth was the largest—a hulking mass of stone with runes glowing along its chest, designed to test everything Ralen had left. He faced it with empty hands, having dropped his axe to pull himself from under a fallen pillar.
For a heartbeat, I thought he'd fail.
Then Ralen roared—not rage, but determination—and charged. He caught the golem's descending fist, muscles screaming, redirected the momentum, and drove his elbow into the glowing core with every ounce of strength he had left.
The core shattered. The golem collapsed into rubble.
Ralen stood in the center of the destruction, chest heaving, covered in dust and blood and sweat.
"Pass," the proctor declared. "Exceptional combat discipline. Warrior path approved."
We erupted in cheers. Mira's relief was palpable through her wisp's sudden brightening. Kaelen was already vaulting the railing before the wards had fully reset.
Ralen grinned through the blood on his teeth. "That all you've got?"

Mira's Trial
Mira stepped into the circle with quiet grace, her wisp circling her shoulder once before settling.
The wards shifted again—this time gentler. The harsh stone arena softened into something more ethereal. Mist rose from the ground. The air grew thick with presence—spirits gathering, curious and cautious.
"Begin," the proctor said.
Three spirit constructs manifested. Not aggressive—testing. A wolf made of moonlight and shadow. A serpent of flowing water. A bird that seemed woven from wind itself.
Mira didn't reach for them. She waited.
The wolf approached first, circling her, assessing. Mira extended her hand slowly—palm up, no demands. An invitation, not a command.
"I see you," she said softly. "Will you lend me your strength?"
The wolf pressed its nose to her palm. The connection formed like a thread of silver light between them.
One by one, the other spirits approached. Mira greeted each with the same quiet respect, the same patient invitation. No force. No binding against their will. Just... asking.
And they answered.
But the trial wasn't meant to be easy.
The wards pulsed. A darker presence emerged—not malevolent, but hungry. A shadow-spirit that tested boundaries, that pushed against her control to see if she'd break or bend.
Mira's expression tightened. Sweat beaded on her forehead.
"Not without consent," she said firmly. "I won't take what isn't offered."
The shadow-spirit surged forward. For a moment I thought it would overwhelm her. Ralen tensed beside me, hand on his axe like he could somehow help from outside the circle.
Then Mira's wisp flared bright.
The shadow-spirit recoiled. Mira stood her ground, surrounded by her willing allies, and the shadow-spirit... settled. Acknowledged. Withdrew.
"Pass," the proctor said, something like surprise in her voice. "Spirit-binding mastery. Mage path approved."
Mira swayed slightly as the spirits dissolved back into mist. But she was smiling.

Kaelen's Trial
Kaelen practically bounced into the circle, twin daggers already in hand.
"Finally," he said. "Thought you'd forgotten about me."
The wards reshaped into a nightmare of traps and obstacles. Pressure plates hidden in the sand. Blade-swings on hair-triggers. Illusions layered over reality. A labyrinth designed to punish hesitation and reward split-second decisions.
"Begin."
Kaelen moved like water, like shadow, like he'd been born knowing where every trap would fire before it did. He ducked under a blade-swing, rolled through an illusion, spotted a pressure plate and leapt it in the same motion.
"Too easy!" he called back, grinning.
The trial adapted. Constructs emerged from hidden panels—mirror images of Kaelen himself, moving with his speed, fighting with his style. He had to battle his own reflection while navigating the deadly maze.
One of the mirror-Kaelens landed a solid hit. Blood on his shoulder. Another caught his ribs. He stumbled, recovered, laughed breathlessly.
"Okay, that's better!"
Ralen shook his head. "He's insane."
"He's Kaelen," Mira said fondly.
We watched him dance through impossible odds—taking hits but always moving forward, always adapting. His daggers flashed in the sunlight. When he finally reached the center sigil and planted his hand on it, he was bleeding from a dozen cuts but still grinning.
"Pass," the proctor said, unable to hide her amusement. "Exceptional adaptability. Warrior path approved, with recommendation for advanced combat specialization."
Kaelen bowed with a flourish, winced, and immediately clutched his ribs. "Worth it."

Ethan's Trial
Then they called my name.
"Ethan Daniels. Step forward."
My pack's voices followed me as I walked to the center. Ralen's steady confidence. Mira's quiet encouragement. Kaelen's irreverent "Don't die!"
I stood in the circle and watched the wards reshape around me.
Five iron sentinels activated—sleeker than Ralen's golems, faster. Clockwork precision in their movements. They spread out, surrounding me.
Competent, I reminded myself. Not exceptional. Just solidly capable.
I drew my practice sword.
The first sentinel lunged. I met it the way Father had taught me—deflect, don't meet force with force. My blade found the joint at its elbow. Sparks flew. The arm separated.
One down.
[System Alert: Combat efficiency nominal]
The notification flickered at the edge of my awareness. I dismissed it automatically, focused on the next threat.
The second and third sentinels attacked in tandem. I moved—trained precision, nothing supernatural. Found openings. Exploited weaknesses. My muscles burned with honest effort.
This was working.
Two more down.
The fourth forced me to adapt. The fifth learned from watching me. By the time I brought them all down, I was breathing hard, drenched in sweat, but intact.
"Adequate combat application," the proctor called. "Transitioning to arcane assessment."
The destroyed sentinels dissolved. The ground reformed into a complex runic lattice—dormant patterns waiting to be activated.
This was the dangerous part.
I knelt at the edge of the lattice, hands hovering over the central glyph. The Radiance stirred in my chest—vast, golden, wanting to surge.
I locked it down.
Small. Keep it small.
The pressure spiked immediately. Sharp. Insistent.
[System Alert: Suppression active – 71%]
I let a thin trickle of mana flow into the lattice. The runes lit up one by one—earth, light, fire, water, air. Traditional elements woven together.
Disruption spells battered my concentration. Illusory strikes clawed at my focus. I held the weave steady, just like the midnight sessions with Vorn had taught me.
My hands trembled. The headache behind my eyes sharpened.
[System Alert: Neural strain detected]
Almost done.
The final glyph ignited. The completed lattice blazed with combined elemental light—brighter than intended, but not blinding. Not legendary.
Just capable.
The light faded. I slumped back, wiping sweat from my face.
"Uncommon versatility," the proctor said. "Hybrid path—adequate proficiency in both martial and arcane disciplines without overspecialization." She made a note. "Pass. Dual-path recommendation."
I'd done it.
Five years of work. Five years of performance.
It had worked.

My pack surrounded me the moment I cleared the boundary.
"Both paths!" Ralen's grin was huge. "Told you."
Kaelen threw an arm around my shoulders. "Mr. Perfectly Balanced strikes again."
"I'm proud of you," Mira said simply, and the words settled warm in my chest.
We'd all passed.
All four of us—warrior, mage, rogue, and the hybrid who didn't quite fit anywhere but somehow fit with them.
"So now we wait," I said.
"For Aurelián," Ralen confirmed.
"They'd be crazy not to want us," Kaelen said.
Mira smiled. "Then let's hope they're not crazy."
We collapsed into laughter—the tension of the day finally breaking. Around us, other successful candidates celebrated with friends and families.
For once, the performance had worked exactly as planned.

That night, after celebrations died down, I slipped to Vorn's secret chamber. The sealed training room where I could finally breathe.
"Congratulations," Vorn said, lighting the ward-lamps.
"Thanks to you," I replied. "Five years of these midnight sessions—"
"You did the work," he interrupted. "How's the suppression holding?"
I considered. "Pretty well. I'd say... maybe seventy percent? Seventy-one? Felt harder during the arcane test, but I got through it."
Vorn's expression tightened slightly. "That's lower than last week."
"It's manageable," I said quickly. "I just need—"
"To release the pressure. I know." He activated the final wards. "Go ahead."
I didn't need to be told twice.
I let the Radiance come.
Golden light erupted, filling the sealed chamber with brilliance that would have blinded anyone watching. The power surged through me—wild, bright, finally free.
For these few precious minutes, I didn't have to be careful. Didn't have to perform.
I could just be.
The pressure in my chest eased. My whole body sighed with relief.
After several minutes, I pulled the Radiance back under control. The light dimmed, settled.
Better. Back to maybe seventy-three percent. I could feel the difference.
"Do you think this is sustainable?" I asked Vorn. "Long-term?"
He was quiet for a moment. "I don't know. But you've managed it this far. And Aurelián will have better resources. Better containment wards. More private spaces for release."
"If we get in."
"When you get in," Vorn corrected firmly. "You and your pack walked that tightrope perfectly today. Aurelián would be foolish not to want you."
I wanted to believe him.
"Hold onto them," he continued quietly. "Whatever else happens—that bond will matter."
"They're the best thing that's happened to me here."
"Then that's what you protect. Not just your secret. Them."

The next two weeks would crawl by like years—waiting for letters that might or might not come, for futures that hung in the balance.
But tonight, standing in the sealed chamber with the remnants of golden light still warming my skin, I let myself feel something I hadn't allowed in a long time.
Hope.
My pack had passed. I'd passed. We'd done it together.
Life was complicated.
But it was still good.
