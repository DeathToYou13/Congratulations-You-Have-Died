Chapter 10 – The Cost to Stand

The air outside the infirmary felt too clean—sterilized by wards that still hummed faintly in the stone. For a long moment no one spoke. The corridor stretched before them, quiet and pale with lantern-light.

“Feels wrong walking away,” Ralen said at last. “Like we’re leaving them behind.”

“We’d just be in the way,” Brenn answered, voice steady but tired. “The healers know what they’re doing.” He glanced back toward the sealed door where Kaelen and Mira slept. “We’d only pace a hole in the floor.”

Sienna folded her arms. “I could still try. I’m good at pacing. Exceptional, really.”

Liora’s smile was small and grim. “Or,” she said softly, “we could use the time to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”

Ethan looked at her. “Meaning?”

“Understanding it,” she said. “The Veil tore because something went wrong, but fear will tear it faster. The best way to conquer fear is through knowledge.” Her eyes hardened. “I need to know whether Tharion had a hand in it. If he did—if he pushed the wards that far—then he put both our friends in danger that nearly killed them. He would need to pay for that.”

Sienna let out a slow breath. “You think he meant for it to happen?”

“I think he meant to win, no matter the cost,” Liora replied. “And that kind of intent doesn’t stop at the edge of a circle.”

Brenn shifted his weight. “So you’re headed to the library.”

“Containment section,” Liora confirmed. “The breach, the wards, the triggers—someone will have written something that can help us understand.”

Sienna groaned. “Fine. I’m coming. Because if you get eaten by a cursed manuscript, I’ll never hear the end of it.”

Ethan nodded. “I’ll go too. If you find something, maybe I can help interpret it.”

Ralen adjusted his axe strap. “We’ll be in the yard. I need to hit something that can actually hit back.”

“Translation,” Sienna said. “You’re going to break things.”

“Probably,” Ralen replied, already turning down the hall. Brenn followed with a short nod.

The group split at the corridor’s crossroads—two paths diverging in the echo of their own helplessness.

---

The path to the Grand Library took them past dim corridors and shuttered classrooms. Every ward hummed under strain, the Spire’s containment field flickering faintly like an overworked heart. The library doors stood sealed—two enormous panels of etched steel framed by a ring of active runes.

A steward in gray robes sat behind a crystalline desk, quill scratching steadily until Liora’s shadow fell across her workspace.

“Containment archives are under lockdown,” the steward said without looking up. “Authorized access only. Level four clearance or faculty sigil required.”

Liora clasped her hands behind her back, all calm professionalism. “We’re researching the Veil rupture,” she said. “Proctor Kane requested a containment analysis.”

The steward glanced up, unimpressed. “I haven’t received such an order.”

“Then consider this a preemptive report,” Sienna said, flashing a disarming smile. “We’ll make sure she knows how helpful you were.”

The steward’s look could have peeled varnish from the desk. “You’re not funny.”

“That’s what everyone keeps telling me,” Sienna muttered.

Liora withdrew a parchment from her satchel, its surface lined with research seals. “Clause 3A. Academic emergency clause. Temporary sigil access.”

The woman sighed, muttering something about scholars and disasters. “One hour,” she said finally, pressing her palm to the console. A flare of silver light etched a floating sigil above Liora’s hand. “If the wards flare, I’ll drag you out myself.”

“Understood,” Liora said evenly.

As the three stepped past the gates, Sienna leaned close. “You have an alarming talent for bureaucracy.”

“Knowledge is built on access,” Liora replied.

“And access,” Sienna said, “is built on audacity.”

Ethan smiled faintly. “You two make a good team.”

“Tragic, isn’t it?” Sienna said.

The wards over the Grand Library parted with a sound like a sigh. Inside, the space rose into quiet immensity—three stories of shelves stretching toward ribbed arches and floating lamps that burned low with golden light. Dust drifted in lazy spirals, catching the faint shimmer of residual magic.

“Spooky,” Sienna said. “I expected screaming or alarms, not… reverent doom.”

“Everyone’s been reassigned to ward maintenance,” Liora replied, scanning the shelves. “Containment theory, breach response… anything about Veil rupture stability.”

“You mean the part where we almost got eaten by magic itself,” Sienna muttered. “Sure, let’s relive that.”

Liora ignored her, running a finger along spines as she murmured catalog numbers. Ethan followed a step behind, eyes flicking toward the engraved support pillars—runes softly glowing, the entire structure breathing faint light.

“You ever feel like this place is listening?” Sienna whispered.

“Only to those who say something worth hearing,” Liora said absently.

Ethan’s voice was quiet. “It feels… heavier than usual. The air.”

“Residual mana,” Liora said. “The Spire bleeds magic even when it sleeps.”

For several minutes they searched in silence, the only sound the faint creak of ladders and the turning of brittle pages. Then Liora stopped. Her hand froze on a narrow, dust-caked volume jammed between two standard warding manuals.

“This shouldn’t be here,” she said.

She pulled the book free. Its leather binding was cracked, and across the cover shimmered a seal made of three thin threads woven in a circle.

“Runic weave,” Liora murmured. “Pre-Aurelian script. Someone hid this here.”

“Hidden things are never good news,” Sienna said, leaning closer despite herself.

Liora opened it carefully. The ink inside had bled to brown with age, but the symbols were still sharp—spiraling runes that coiled inward around a single glyph for *self*.

“This isn’t about breaches,” she said softly. “It’s about binding. A weave meant to suppress an individual’s magic—seal it dormant inside them. It requires three casters: one to stabilize, one to weave, one to seal.”

“That’s horrifying,” Sienna said. Then, with a crooked grin: “Though it’d be a great idea for Tharion. Maybe every shadeweaver while we’re at it.”

“Tempting,” Liora admitted. “But too advanced for casual punishment.”

Ethan said nothing. The spiraling runes seemed to shift under his gaze, gold glinting faintly.

A faint pressure bloomed behind Ethan’s sternum—wrong rhythm, wrong timing—then faded as quickly as it came.

*If it could be undone,* he thought, *maybe it could keep people safe. Keep me from—*

A pulse of warmth flickered beneath his ribs. The ink glowed gold for a heartbeat, then dimmed.

Liora frowned. “Residual charge?” She closed the tome carefully. “It doesn’t belong in containment. Or anywhere unsupervised.”

“Then maybe we shouldn’t be standing next to it,” Sienna suggested. “Books that glow are never good news.”

Liora hesitated, then slid the volume back into its narrow gap. “Fine. But I’ll find out who moved it here.”

“Of course you will,” Sienna said. “And I’ll make sure you don’t die doing it.”

Ethan followed them toward the exit, the golden light of the shelves dimming behind them.

Somewhere deep in the stacks, the hidden tome pulsed once—faint and patient, like a heartbeat that refused to die.

None of them noticed the whisper of wardlight traveling upward—carrying the echo of the tome they’d touched.

The Spire listened—
and carried its secrets higher.

---

Far above the quiet heart of the library, in the stormlit tower of the Headmaster’s sanctum, Proctor Valeria Kane stood before the desk of Highmaster Serath Valthorne.

Lightning clawed across the windows, painting the room in violent white. The light caught on the crystalline lattice of Valthorne’s staff, on the stacks of sealed reports that ringed his desk like a fortress of parchment and memory. The man himself barely moved—tall, thin, robed in layered sigils that pulsed faintly beneath the cloth, his eyes pale and sharp as fractured quartz.

“You’re late,” he said, not unkindly. “Sit, Proctor.”

Valeria didn’t. “With respect, sir, I’d rather stand.”

One corner of his mouth ticked upward. “You usually do.” He turned a page in the report. “Tell me.”

“The breach manifested during the Valen girl’s trial,” she said. “There were dozens before hers—controlled, predictable—but the wards began to destabilize when she stepped into the circle. The rupture originated inside the containment field, not from an external source.”

“Not compromised?”

“No, sir. Overloaded.” She hesitated. “The residual readings were irregular. One shadeweave signature entwined with the spiritbound source, as expected—but there was also a faint trace of radiant energy threaded through the collapse.”

“Radiant? From the Valen girl?”

“Unlikely. It didn’t match her frequency. The resonance came from near the perimeter—someone close enough to influence the wards.”

“Your assessment?”

“Possibly environmental bleed,” she said carefully. “Or… an observer with strong Radiant affinity. Someone who didn’t realize their presence affected the containment field.”

“Accidental interference?”

“Maybe. But the signature was stable, deliberate. It felt like someone’s control faltered at the worst possible moment.”

“Do you have a name in mind?”

“No, sir. Not evidence. Just a pattern.”

“Patterns are how we find evidence,” Valthorne replied. “You did well to notice it.”

The praise startled her. “Then you believe we should investigate further?”

“Of course. Preparedness is not paranoia. But we act with precision, not panic. Containment first, analysis second. If you find a link, you bring it to me directly.”

“Understood.”

“And the entity?”

“Banished—temporarily. Mira Valen reasserted the seal, but it… recognized her. It spoke her name.”

“Demons speak many names.”

“Not like this one,” Valeria said. “It used lineage titles. Old ones. It mentioned dragons.”

The word hung heavy in the air.

Valthorne closed the report slowly. “Dragons,” he murmured. “That word should never reach the Council. Not until we understand what it means.”

“So you do believe—”

“I believe nothing yet,” he interrupted. “But I remember enough to be cautious.”

“Caution and silence aren’t the same thing, sir.”

“No. But one often protects the other.” He rose, tall and slender, the runes along his sleeves flickering faintly. “There are bindings older than the Spire—contracts that predate our Orders. It would be wise not to stir them without cause.”

“Are we certain they weren’t stirred already?”

He held her gaze. Something older—something wounded—flickered behind his calm.

“Containment, Proctor,” he said softly. “Not complacency.”

Valeria inclined her head. “As you command.”

“And Valeria,” he added as she reached the door, “if anyone asks about the name *Valthor*—tell them it’s a myth. A comforting one, if you can manage it.”

The door seals whispered shut behind her.

Outside, the storm broke again—rain streaking the glass. Lightning flared, catching briefly on the Highmaster’s sigils, outlining them in gold and silver like wings preparing to take flight.

---

The private combat hall was nearly empty at this hour, save for the echo of rain against the tall windows and the low pulse of wardlight under the floor. Faint runes glowed along the boundary circle—training wards, not tournament-grade, but strong enough to hold two determined fighters.

Ralen tightened his gauntlets without looking up. Across from him, Brenn rolled his shoulder plates, testing the joints. They hadn’t known each other long—barely since arrival at Aurelián—but shared danger forged connections strange and deep. The demon’s howl still lived behind both their ribs.

“Standard rules?” Brenn asked.

“Standard,” Ralen said. “No strikes above the shoulder. No killing blows.”

“Good,” Brenn grunted. “I’m not in the mood to drag you to the infirmary.”

Ralen’s answer was a thin, humorless smile. “You could try.”

The wards shimmered blue as they stepped inside the circle.

**Steel met steel.**

Their first exchange was clean, controlled—almost ritualistic. Brenn fought like a mountain, hammer movements measured and efficient. Ralen fought like a blade drawn on instinct, sharp and restless.

For a few breaths, it was just training. Motion. Rhythm.

Then Brenn said quietly, “Feels strange—being alive after that.”

“Strange?” Ralen parried, the sound ringing too hard. “Try useless.”

“You weren’t useless.”

“Didn’t stop it, did I?”
His next strike came down harder. “Didn’t stop anything.”

“Mira did.”

“I should’ve helped her!”

Black ash, Mira’s blood, Kaelen’s ragged breathing—
the memories slammed into Ralen harder than any blow.

His strikes picked up speed, edge, a wildness that had no place in practice.

“Ease up,” Brenn warned.

“I’m fine.”

“You’re not.”

Ralen slashed again—too fast, too angry.

“Kaelen on the ground—Mira choking on magic—and I just stood there!”

“We all did what we could.”

“I’m supposed to protect them,” Ralen choked, the words ripping out before he could stop them.
“It wasn’t enough! I wasn’t enough!”

That truth ripped through him like a blade.

The **red shimmer** at the edge of his vision began to pulse—slow at first, then faster. Heat rolled off him. The runes carved along his forearms flickered alive, as if remembering a purpose older than his restraint.

Brenn felt the shift.
“Ralen,” he said quietly. “Breathe.”

“Don’t tell me to breathe!”

Another swing—wild, savage.

“You didn’t feel it!” Ralen roared. “That thing! That hunger! I couldn’t stop it—I couldn’t stop *myself!*”

“You did enough,” Brenn said quietly. “Enough to still be standing here with me. You’re stopping now.”

“No,” Ralen growled. “Not this time.”

**His aura ignited.**

Red light crawled across his shoulders, vein-like and furious. The air thickened, metallic. The runes in the floor quivered.

“Ralen—eyes on me,” Brenn snapped, stepping in, refusing to back up.

But Ralen wasn’t seeing Brenn.
He wasn’t seeing anything in this room.

“You want to talk about helpless?” Ralen spat. “THIS is helpless!”

Brenn saw it happen. “Ralen—don’t you lose it!”

Something inside Ralen *lunged*, snapping its leash.

He surged forward—fast enough to blur.

Brenn barely got his hammer up.

“You couldn’t have saved them!” Brenn shouted. “No one could!”

“I SHOULD HAVE TRIED HARDER!”

The strike rattled Brenn down to his spine. The next was worse. Ralen hammered at him, fury building with every breath—grief twisting into something feral.

“Ralen—listen! You’re hitting the wrong enemy!”

But Ralen didn’t hear him.

His entire body coiled for a killing arc.

**Brenn recognized it too late.**

“Too slow—” Brenn muttered.

The axe came down like a dropping moon.

He threw his hammer up—wrong angle, wrong stance.

The impact slammed into his bracer hard enough to spark. Shock punched up his arm—hot, blinding pain. The runes along the ward circle flared white, then sputtered.

Brenn’s knee hit the ground.

A lesser fighter would have died.

The axe head hovered inches from his skull—
held back only because Brenn, through sheer stubborn strength, *locked it there* with a desperate brace.

His arm jolted again—bad bruising, maybe a fracture—but he held.

“Ralen—” Brenn rasped. “Don’t… make me haunt you.”

The words hit like a bell struck inside Ralen’s ribs.

His breath caught.
His fingers spasmed.
The red aura **snapped**—not fading, but collapsing inward.

Clarity crashed into him like cold water.

He stumbled back as if burned by his own hands.

“Brenn—what did I—? I didn’t—did I…?”
His voice was a broken whisper. “Did I almost—?”

Brenn rose slowly, cradling his bruised arm. He rolled the shoulder once—breath hissing sharply through his teeth—and hid the wince badly.

“Yeah,” he said. “You almost got me. But almost doesn’t count.”

Ralen flinched—not from Brenn, but from himself.
His hand hovered uselessly in the air, fingers twitching like they didn’t know who they belonged to.

“I’ve never—” He swallowed. “I’ve never lost the thread like that. Not once. I’m supposed to protect them. And I almost—”

His breath shuddered. “I almost hurt *you.*”

Brenn stepped close, laying his good hand on Ralen’s shoulder.

“You love them,” Brenn said. “That’s why this happened.”

Ralen’s jaw trembled. “I don’t get to lose control. That’s not who I am.”

“It is,” Brenn said gently. “Sometimes. And that’s why there are two of us in this circle.”

Ralen’s eyes burned. “I can’t let it happen again.”

“Then we train,” Brenn said. “Until the fury answers to you.”

Ralen breathed once—shaky, but real.
“…Again,” he said softly. “But slower.”

Brenn grinned crookedly. “Try for my head again, and I *will* punch you in the face. With my gauntlet. You will bleed—a lot.”

Ralen let out a rough, strangled laugh. “Fair trade.”

They reset.

The next strike Ralen threw was controlled. Completely.

The storm outside eased.
Inside the hall, two boys kept their footing—and their promise to stand.

Rain tapped against the glass in a rhythm almost like applause. The storm hadn’t passed—but it was learning to quiet.

They kept sparring, the clash of steel and rune-lit metal fading into a steady rhythm. Neither fought to win—only to feel steady again. Each swing, each block, chipped away at the noise inside them, until their movements became less about anger and more about control.

Beyond the training hall’s warded windows, the storm began to break, its rumble softening into the long hush that precedes twilight. Aurelián Spire stood wreathed in mist and the faint orange glow of a dying sun—

**And within its walls, two fighters found their balance again—swing by steady swing.**
