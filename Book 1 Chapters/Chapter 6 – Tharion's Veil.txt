# Chapter 6 – Tharion's Veil

The earth swallowed Ralen's maze like it had never been there.

One moment: walls grinding, dust hanging in the air, Ralen Veyr limping to the center rune with his axe as a crutch.

The next: flat packed earth, runes dimming, only the ache of the yard and the taste of grit in everyone's teeth.

A faint vibration still hung in the ground—Ralen's collapse echoing through the stone, dust still drifting like breath in cold air. The arena hadn't forgotten what it just devoured.

Neither had I.

He was still breathing. Still standing. The first to pass.

Good. Someone needed to prove this place wasn't just a story nobles told themselves about merit.

Proctor Kane's verdict still hung in the air—short, brutal, accurate. The kind of assessment you could sharpen yourself against.

My knuckles were white on the rail and I made myself ease them.

Brute strength. Controlled rage. Bone-deep stubbornness. Ralen had all three. The maze had tried to crush him, and he'd broken it instead.

It was impressive.

It was also the wrong kind of power for House Draemir.

We don't win by being struck the hardest. We win by making sure the blow never lands.

The wards thrummed underfoot, resetting. The yard smoothed itself into a blank slate again, runes fading to an expectant glow.

Kane's voice cut through it all. "Tharion Draemir."

Every head turned.

I felt their eyes like hands pressing on my shoulders. Hungry. Judging. Waiting for the serpent's heir to fail, to prove that House Draemir's decline wasn't just rumor but destiny.

The crest on my chest—coiled serpent through shadowed thorns—felt heavier than it had this morning. Two years of holding it up, and some days it still felt like it might crush me.

I stepped away from the terrace rail. Gavren's hand brushed my shoulder in passing—a touch light enough I could pretend I hadn't felt it.

"Make it choke," he muttered.

Selara's eyes, all knives and polish, flicked toward the wards instead of my face. Veyric just grunted once, low and steady. That was his blessing.

I walked toward the arena. Spine straight. Head up. The way Mother taught me before the fever took her.

*Act like you're winning, even when you're losing. Especially then.*

My rapier hummed against my hip, shadow-threaded and hungry. Behind me, I felt Gavren's presence—solid, steady. Selara's too-bright confidence. Veyric's quiet weight. The three people left who hadn't abandoned Draemir when the forges went cold.

Not friends. Allies. There's a difference, and I'd learned it young.

The air in the yard felt different now—thicker, like breath held between teeth. Two hundred candidates watched as I crossed the flattened earth toward the center. Somewhere on the terraces, Ethan Daniels' little pack clustered near the ward-line: Dawnspire's darlings, plus the volcanic wildling and her hammer friend, plus the rune-girl whose gaze weighed everything.

Their faces blurred into a single impression: warmth, cohesion, belonging.

It irritated me more than the whispers did.

Kane stepped back to the arena's edge. Silent. Watching with those scarred, measuring eyes.

The wards around the arena began to pulse. Preparing.

Around the perimeter, healers took their positions, white robes stark against storm-dark stone. Professional. Ready. The Spire doesn't let students die in trials.

Usually.

I reached the threshold—

White light snapped up like a wall. Blinding. The entire yard flinched.

The barrier pulsed once where I stood, brighter, washing over me. I felt it—scanning, assessing, reading something in my mana or my intent or the threads of shadow I kept coiled tight beneath my ribs.

Then the grinding began.

Behind the light, something massive took shape. Stone cracking. Glass rising. The sound of a thousand mirrors shattering and reforming into something that knew my name.

I'd heard about Aurelián's ritual. The arena reads you and builds your trial custom. Finds what you're good at and tests whether you're good enough.

Or finds what you fear and asks if you'll break.

The sounds continued—shifting, building, locking into place with crystalline precision.

Then I stepped through.

The moment I crossed the threshold, the wards shifted.

Not fading. *Transforming.*

The white wall turned crystalline—sharper than glass, clearer than air. Everything inside snapped into hyper-clarity for two hundred watching eyes.

They could see everything now.

Good. Let them watch.

---

A mirrored coliseum sprawled before me, walls rippling with false reflections that moved wrong—too slow, too fast, predatory. The air tasted of shadows and old malice, thick with shadeweave that wasn't mine.

This was home. All the worst parts of it.

Whispers crawled along the edges—Draemhold's ashes, Mother's last breath rattling in her chest, the magistrate's stamp slamming SEIZED across another ledger.

Shadeweave doesn't attack. It waits. Lets you look inward first, then feeds on what it finds.

I looked at the path instead.

My rapier slid free with a whisper of steel. I threaded shadow along its edge—just enough to sharpen, not enough to hook. Control. That's what separates a shadeweaver from a corpse wearing a serpent's crest.

The first construct emerged from a mirror's surface, wearing my face. Same height. Same posture. Same bitter set to the mouth.

It smiled—fractionally too warm, too hopeful—and split into four mid-lunge.

Common trick. Illusions don't displace air the same way flesh and steel do. I tracked the weight distribution, let three phantoms pass harmless, and caught the real one on the bind.

Its blade scraped along mine. Wrong angle. Constructs never quite match living steel.

I rolled its point off my guard and sank mine where neck meets shoulder. The notch opens clean if you know the geometry.

Smoke. Glass dust scattering like black snow.

A sliver caught my forearm—shallow, stinging. First blood.

Good. Pain keeps the ledger honest.

The mirrors slid on silent hinges, corridors reforming. The floor clicked beneath my boots—pressure plates counting mistakes I hadn't made yet.

The whispering rose: marsh-wind over stagnant water, coin clinking in empty coffers, a boy's footsteps echoing in halls that grew emptier every year.

Two years since Mother died. Two years managing debt-collectors and fading retainers and nobles who smiled while calculating how to carve up Draemir's corpse.

I was twelve. I didn't get to be twelve.

Two more constructs slid from a seam—mirrored scales, eel-quick. One feinted high. One raked low.

I threaded shade along my blade as I set the flat against the rake. The shadow bit as I drove through both guards. Four beats: elbow, shoulder, throat, core.

Clean. Economical. The kind of efficiency Mother called "worthy of the name."

They fell in near-silence.

The coliseum's psychic wind pressed harder, as if efficiency offended it.

From somewhere beyond the wards, I heard Sienna's voice: "Snake's precise."

Not praise. Observation. I'd take it.

The mirrors tilted inward, narrowing the corridor to a throat lined with my own reflections. A hundred Tharions wearing the same exhausted defiance.

Then the glass flickered—and showed me what it wanted me to see.

---

The fen came first.

Raw. Wet. Ancient. Lord Ebon Draemir, hip-deep in marsh water during the Dragon Wars, palm outstretched toward something that had no right to exist. An abyssal shade—echo of a slain wyrm's lingering malice, all hunger and resentment given form.

The thing pressed its muzzle to his hand. A pact inked in breath and old wounds.

*Veilshadow.* The seed of our art. Our first bargain with darkness.

Beyond the reed-line, Alaris banners blazed radiant. The royal family in their golden glory, searing dragon-hide with light that could shame the sun.

We couldn't beat that. So we learned to make it look elsewhere.

My blade cut through the memory. The glass rippled and reformed.

A court, centuries later. Lady Vespera Draemir—the Veil Sovereign—smiling while courtiers forgot their own names. Memory-threads sliding from skulls into crystal jars like silk through rings. Polite. Gentle. Utterly ruthless.

She lifted one jar, weighing it like fruit, and her unblinking eyes found mine across centuries.

*We don't steal, Tharion. We rearrange. Then everyone calls it fate.*

Efficient. Elegant. And it destroyed her in the end—eclipse backlash ate her mind from the inside until she couldn't remember which memories were hers.

A construct stepped from her smile. Rapier to rapier.

We crossed once. Twice. Three times. I read its guard, found the rhythm, made the fourth exchange a lesson. Half-beat of shade to confuse its tracking, steel where the illusion parted.

It fell.

The mirrors cooled to night.

An Alaris manor burned without flame. The Night of Silent Blades, 150 years gone but still bleeding in the present. Tomes turning to ash. Pact records erased. Guilt sewn onto innocents like a garment we tailored to fit.

In one pane, a boy watched from a balcony. Not me—close enough that my ribs remembered the shape of that ache anyway.

Ash fell like black snow. Somewhere in the distance, something draconic laughed. Old. Patient. Wronged.

This is what we are, the glass whispered. This is what you're becoming.

"Stand, Tharion!" Gavren's voice, from beyond the ward. A rope I didn't ask for.

Then—

A hair-thin filament of shadeweave licked through the barrier. Selara. Daring and foolish, trying to trip a construct for me, trying to *help*.

The wards screamed.

The thread snapped with a crack like breaking bone. The arena convulsed, fusing two nearby shades into a single hulking mass that hit me before I could curse.

A fist like a door. I met a mirror spine-first.

Glass shattered into a dozen panes, each reflecting a dozen versions of failure.

Kane's bellow hammered across the sand. "Interfere again and you're out!"

The mass advanced, eyes pulsing slow violet—Umbral stain, the color shades wear when they've fed too long on fear.

Its presence tugged at the threads coiled in my chest, purring: *Join. Draw deep. End this.*

For one breath, mercy wore that voice.

"No."

The word cost blood I couldn't afford.

It swung. I read it half a beat late—exhaustion showing, finally. Claws laid three clean lines across my side.

Heat flared. I gave the pain a job: timing.

Dropped under the next swing, drove my point into the hinge of its knee. Shadeweave bit deep. I twisted.

Backlash lit my nerves white. The price of forcing shadow through solid form.

Obsidian dust gusted outward. The construct collapsed.

I stood into breath again. Ribs protesting. Blood warming my hip.

The glass brightened.

A war council, five centuries back. Queen Lirael Alaris bent over maps of wyrm warrens, radiant and golden and sure. At her shoulder, Vespera's hand resting light. Invisible threads sliding into doubt.

A strike delayed by a day. A clutch saved. Legends built on foundations we provided.

I hated the beauty of it. Envied the control.

"Snake's cutting through," Kaelen's voice drifted over the ward. Dry. Assessing.

My shoulder hummed where bone had rung against stone. Blood soaked into boot leather. The body doesn't lie when the mind wants to.

The corridor opened into a bridge of mirrors over crawling shadow. Each step birthed specters—Gavren whispering *you need us*, Selara smiling *we made you*, Veyric rumbling *you're our spine*.

Then someone else stepped from the glass.

Ethan Daniels. Not speaking. Just looking. Not pity. Not challenge.

Attention without a hook in it. That was worse.

My foot stuttered.

Shadow-hands seized my ankle. I cut down on reflex, severing the wrist. The panel steadied.

Then Mother stood ahead.

Young. Unlined. Marsh-light painting her hair like false gold, the way it looked before the fever yellowed her skin and hollowed her cheeks.

"Be the serpent that thrives," she said softly. Like when I was small enough to mistake duty for love. "Even if it means you must bite the world."

The panel tilted. I dropped to one knee.

The pit beneath breathed shadow into my mouth. Panic closed cold and fast.

I fed it fuel instead of fighting it. The forges going cold. Retainers leaving in the night. Debt-collectors measuring the manor for what they'd take when I finally failed.

I pushed a burst of shadeweave through the bridge. Tight. Controlled. The grasping hands came apart like rotted net.

The blast blistered my nerves. Worth it. The boards steadied.

I kept moving.

Halfway across, the mirrors kinked into a vault from the Dimming-era, when shadeweave ran wild without radiance to balance it. Eclipse backlash eating crowns. Heirs clawing their scalps to free spiders only they could see.

Someone laughed in my voice.

I moved faster.

Beyond the bridge, a round chamber waited. Mirrors climbing to a high dome. The floor was black water reflecting not me as I was, but as hungers preferred: a beloved lord crafted from fear, a clean-handed prince in a court that forgave itself, a boy who never learned to want anything but the next ledger redrawn in someone else's blood.

At the chamber's center, a sigil pulsed—an Umbral Heart. Living shade-thread beating with that slow violet throb.

The trial's core.

Draw deep, and the arena would fold like paper. Restore the house. Prove Draemir isn't dying.

Draw deep, and the threads might not let go.

I'm talented. Talented enough I might even survive it—ten percent chance, maybe fifteen if I'm being generous with myself.

Two years holding the house together taught me something: fifteen percent isn't odds. It's a prayer.

And I stopped praying when they lowered Mother into the ground.

A colossus rose around the Heart, veiled in layered shadeweave bristling with psychic barbs. Each breath returned with a hook: *be seen, be feared, be forgiven, be anything but forgotten.*

I am twelve years old, I thought with strange calm. Twelve, and this is what they call education.

It struck.

I misread by a finger—fatigue bleeding through precision. Its fist glanced my shoulder. White noise bloomed.

I rode it like a metronome. Cut. Breathe. Step.

The first veil parted like a scab. The colossus keened without sound.

Second swing. I set the flat. Bones rang. Second veil. Third.

The barbs bit deeper. Visions sharpening into things I hadn't lived but wanted desperately: Vespera lowering a crown with approval. Mother in shadow, saying *well done* and meaning it. The forges lit again, smoke rising like prayers answered.

The pack appeared—whole, laughing, together in a way that didn't require ledgers or leverage.

For the barest heartbeat: *I wish I could be like them.*

It felt like a crack opening in winter ice.

Want is a knife with two edges. I know which one cuts deeper.

Fourth veil. Heat bled down my thigh. Fifth. The chamber pulsed violet.

The final veil wore that color like a brand.

*This is where Draemir heirs go wrong,* the mirrors whispered. *This is where they choose speed over spine.*

Behind my teeth, fear hammered: *You will never be enough. Not for the house. Not for the ghosts. Not for yourself.*

I made that fear pick up the rapier.

"Not today," I told the Heart.

I put every terror of becoming my father—a name more than a memory, a story I've been punished for living up to or failing to—into the thrust.

Steel slid clean through the core.

The colossus convulsed, trying to swallow itself back into survivable shape. The veils shredded. Stone sighed to dust. Shadow unspooled into smoke.

Silence closed like a fist.

The mirrors showed only me: sweat-slick, shallow cuts mapped across forearm and ribs and thigh, robe torn, eyes that had learned not to flinch when looking at ruins.

A child in a costume that fit too well.

The yard returned—flat earth, ordinary wind, the thin sound of people who love spectacle more than truth.

In the crowd beyond the barrier, I caught a glimpse of a girl with a glowing notebook. She wasn't watching the spectacle—she was tracking patterns, analyzing the structure of my choices the way I'd analyzed the trial's geometry.

For a heartbeat, I recognized something: an intellect that saw architecture where others saw chaos.

I looked away before she could notice me noticing.

I remained standing. Barely.

Beneath my boots, the sigil flared—charcoal threads knitting into a mark: serpent coiled through mirrored facets, the Umbral Heart pierced. It burned into the ground, set, and faded to ember.

The wardweb drank it like a memory and went still.

I exhaled. Realized my hands were shaking.

Not from pain. From the way the dark had said my name and meant *belong*.

A faint pulse answered somewhere in my bones—one echo, no more. Like the Heart's beat hadn't fully let me go. My shadow lagged a half-inch behind my step before snapping back into place. No one else noticed. I made myself breathe through it.

*This is insane,* I thought, late and cold. Not a test of skill but of whether your ghosts fit your bones. If I'd drawn deeper, I might've walked out with something else wearing my face.

Twelve years old. And this is "recruitment."

Good. Better to know the shape of the knife before it finds your ribs.

---

Kane crossed the sand with measured steps, halberd carried like a verdict that didn't need volume.

She stopped within arm's length. Met my eyes.

And paused.

Not pity. Recognition. The kind that costs the giver something.

Her voice dropped, low enough only I could hear: "I know the weight that stalks you. Blood and legacy with teeth."

It slipped past every defense I had. She'd seen me—not the crest, not the sneer, not the house. The boy underneath all of it.

It almost broke me.

Then iron returned, voice carrying to the yard: "Your control is exemplary. Shadeweave and blade in true accord. You stood where others drown."

She set the halberd's butt into the earth with a solid thunk.

"But you lean too hard on shadow. Serpents thrive in corners, but light finds everything in time. The Spire bends for no legacy. Pride won't stitch your wounds."

She let that settle.

"Pass."

The word moved through the ranks like wind shifting. Judgment given. Lesson delivered.

The sympathy shuttered in her eyes, replaced by the clinical assessment of a proctor who'd made her call.

Healers approached at her gesture, hands glowing soft gold. Their magic stung, then cooled—sealing cuts, damping the shoulder's throb, knitting the gouge along my ribs into an itchy line.

I let them work. Kept breathing until the tremor left my hands.

The Umbral pull still smudged beneath my nails like soot that wouldn't wash clean.

---

You're alone now, the quiet said.

Yes. But I had been trained for alone. Taught that kindness is a debt you can't repay and friendship is a lie that collapses when the ledger turns. The worst part is simpler:

I miss being loved by people I'm now required to call despicable.

My mother's palm on my cheek when the ledgers looked worst.

They were a chain. They were also warm.

Without them, the House is only instructions.

And I am the last page still being written.

---

The wards softened. Sound returned. Salt and dust settled back into ordinary air.

Gavren shouldered through first—grin cracked wide with relief more than calculation. He clapped my uninjured shoulder, felt the flinch, gentled his hand.

"Knew you'd make it choke," he said, voice rough.

Selara slid in beside him, beautiful and sharp as broken glass. "When you cut the Heart—I thought it would take you. You fed it fear instead."

"Your interference nearly got me killed," I said. Edge sharpened enough to remind, dulled enough not to wound.

Her chin dipped. "Won't happen again."

"See that it doesn't."

Veyric hovered a step back, steady as stone. "Big one fell. Good cut."

They stayed close as the healers finished—three bodies orbiting a star that refused to admit it needed their heat.

*Useful,* I reminded myself. *They're loyal because I make them valuable. Because I'm valuable back.*

But when Selara's fingers lingered on my sleeve, when Gavren's laugh still shook with leftover fear—

Something tilted under my ribs. They weren't cheering the crest.

They were cheering me.

I buried it where soft things go to die: deep, fast, alone.

---

Ethan's pack intercepted us near the boundary.

Ralen stood like a wall that respected the work—the only one who'd faced a trial so far. Mira's wisp burned even and calm. Kaelen wore a grin people mistake for harmless. Sienna's eyes sparked, looking for argument. Brenn's arms were crossed, measuring.

Ethan's gaze was steady. Uncomfortably so.

"You fought well," he said. Simple. Unperformed. "That was brutal. You didn't let it take you."

I searched his face for hooks. For pity. For the price hiding in the kindness.

Found nothing.

It unsettled me more than contempt would have.

"Keep your pity," I said.

"Wasn't pity." Sienna, spark on tinder. "Respect."

"Spend it elsewhere. Respect is for equals."

Kaelen's grin thinned. "You'll find fewer of those if you can't stomach any."

Ralen's voice came like gravel settling. "You bled and didn't break. That counts."

Mira's wisp pulsed softly. "Your threads want to devour you. You sing against them anyway."

"Don't test poetry on me," I said, watching Ethan.

Brenn, who'd stayed quiet, uncrossed his arms. "You walk like someone with too much weight on his back. Don't let it snap you before the Spire does."

No mockery. Just recognition from someone who knew what carrying things felt like.

Ethan nodded. "Plain, then. You passed. We will too. Rivals—not enemies—unless you make it so."

The words hit harder than they should have.

*Rivals, not enemies.*

Rivals could coexist. Rivals could understand each other. Enemies didn't need to.

For one heartbeat, I wanted to believe him.

Then the moment passed.

I forced a smirk sharp enough to hide the hesitation. "You mistake me for someone who wants company, Daniels."

Enemies are clean. Rivals require choices I can't afford.

I let the silence stretch long enough to become a decision.

Then turned my shoulder. "Gavren. Selara. Veyric."

They moved when I did.

Behind us, the pack's murmur stayed respectful. Ethan's gaze followed a step too far—not pushing, not holding. Just there.

It was worse than pressure.

---

We took the long way under an empty arch. Selara's voice, low: "Kane saw you."

"Enough," I said. Not rebuke. Agreement.

Gavren snorted—half-laugh gone thin. "Was that kindness?"

"Kane doesn't do kind. She does accurate. Today I walked straight enough not to fall."

Veyric nodded, satisfied by the geometry. "Straight's good."

*Straight is seen,* I thought. *And seen is where the light learns your shape.*

House Draemir taught me to be effective without being caught. The Spire asks me to be witnessed.

For one heartbeat, someone looked past the serpent to the son and didn't demand an apology for either.

It almost cracked the shell I welded shut the night they lowered Mother into the ground.

I hated Kane for that.

If I were a different boy, I might have thanked her.

The wards called another name. The yard shifted its hunger.

I set my hand on my rapier. The hilt hummed once—patient, predatory, pleased.

I am talented. Best blade in our year, whether they know it yet or not. Shadeweave that could drown me if I let it.

I wear arrogance like armor because I can't afford to be small.

I despise their warmth because if it isn't weakness, it means I'm missing something essential.

I am twelve. I am alone. And I am the last page of a book that keeps rewriting itself in other people's blood.

House Draemir's venom lives.

Aurelián will taste it.

And if Kane is right, and light finds everything in time?

Then I'll teach the dark to bite back without swallowing me whole.

Or drown trying.

Either way—the ledger balances.
