Chapter 25 – The Honest Cage

The path narrowed as they climbed, ice giving way to bare stone worn smooth by centuries of wind. The air thinned until each breath burned, and even Valeria's pace slowed to accommodate lungs that struggled against the altitude.
The bronze dragon still circled overhead. Patient. Watching.
"How much farther?" Sienna gasped, flames sputtering weakly in the thin air.
"There." Valeria pointed to where the mountain face split open—a massive fissure that yawned like a mouth, darkness pooling within.
The convergence chamber.
They stopped at the entrance. The temperature dropped twenty degrees in the span of three steps, magical cold rather than natural. Something ancient lived here. Something that remembered what it meant to rule the sky.
"Final check," Valeria said quietly. "Weapons ready. Wards prepared. Once we enter, there's no retreat until the ritual completes or fails."
Brenn's hands glowed with earth-light. Sienna's flames steadied despite the cold. Liora traced runes in the air that hung suspended, ready. Mira's wisp expanded, wrapping them all in a gentle protective warmth.
Kaelen's daggers appeared in his hands like they'd always been there. Ralen's grip on his axe was white-knuckled.
Tharion's shadows coiled tighter, and behind him, Gavren, Selara, and Veyric moved into formation—ready.
And Lucien...
Lucien felt the radiant light pooling in his hands, stolen power from a stolen soul in a stolen body, and wondered if that made him a fitting messenger for a ritual built on truth.
"Together," Mira whispered through the bond.
"Together," the Pack echoed.
They entered the dark.

The chamber opened before them like a cathedral to forgotten gods.
Massive. Impossibly massive. The ceiling disappeared into shadow far overhead, and the walls curved away in sweeping arcs that suggested the space had been carved by claws rather than tools. Ley-lines pulsed through the stone itself—visible threads of power that thrummed with barely contained energy.
And at the center, sprawled across a platform of obsidian that might once have been a throne, lay Valthor.
He was enormous even dying. Scales the color of old bronze, dulled with age and illness but still gleaming with predatory magnificence. Wings folded against his sides, membranes torn and tattered but the span suggested he could blot out the sun. Horns curved back from his skull like a crown of blades, each one as long as a man was tall.
And his eyes—ancient, intelligent, hungry—tracked their approach with the focus of something that had spent six centuries perfecting the art of killing.
The air itself felt heavier near him. Wrong. Like reality bent slightly around his presence, acknowledging something that shouldn't exist in the modern age.
"So." His voice wasn't a rumble—it was an avalanche that resonated in their bones, their teeth, the hollow spaces in their chests. "The children come to fix what their ancestors broke."
Several of them stumbled. The sheer weight of that voice was physical.
Lucien felt the gaze pin him like an insect. Felt it catalog him—flesh, bone, soul—and find every weakness, every fear, every doubt.
"Valthor," Valeria said, stepping forward. Her voice was steady but Lucien saw her knuckles white on her halberd. "We've come to—"
"I know why you've come." The dragon shifted, and the movement sent tremors through stone. Dust fell from the ceiling. "The Pact fails. The bindings weaken. Soon my kin will wake, and what your Thorne Alaris prevented two centuries ago will resume."
His lips pulled back, revealing teeth like swords—each one stained with old blood, old victories, old cruelty.
"Tell me, children. Do you know what it was like? The war?" His eyes gleamed with something worse than malice. Nostalgia. "Six hundred years of burning your cities. Crushing your armies. Teaching humanity what it meant to be prey."
He leaned forward slightly, and the temperature in the chamber dropped another ten degrees.
"I miss it. Every. Single. Day."
Ralen's hand tightened on his axe. Through the bond, Lucien felt the Pack's instinctive terror warring with trained discipline.
This wasn't a dying prisoner. This was an apex predator temporarily caged.
"We're here about the Pact," Lucien managed, voice steadier than he felt.
"Of course you are." Valthor settled back, movements deceptively lazy. "And you think you can stop it with clever weaving and childhood idealism." A pause. "How did you get here so quickly, I wonder?"
Lucien's blood froze.
"Five days from Aurelián to the Elder Peaks. The Pact was failing, yes, but I had perhaps two weeks before full collapse." Those ancient eyes narrowed. "Then suddenly you're running. Racing. Desperate."
He gestured with one massive claw toward the bronze dragon circling outside.
"Did you like my message, young Alaris? Three passes over your ancestral home. Very specific. Very deliberate."
The world tilted.
"You..." Lucien couldn't finish.
"I sent Kirath to burn your house, yes." Valthor's tone was conversational. "Not to kill—I'm not wasteful with leverage. Just to... motivate. You were taking too long. I didn't have time for you to walk leisurely while I died."
"You could have just asked—" Sienna started.
"ASKED?" Valthor's laugh was like breaking stone. "I am not some supplicant begging for scraps. I am Valthor, Patriarch of the Bronze Flight, conqueror of the Southern Reaches, breaker of the Radiant Kingdoms." His voice dropped to something quieter, more dangerous. "I don't ask. I take. Or in this case—I motivate."
He studied Lucien with those predatory eyes.
"You chose to continue climbing. Chose to save the world instead of running home. Good. That's the kind of ruthlessness that survives. Your parents might be ash, might be alive, but either way—you made the hard choice." A pause. "Very dragon of you."
Lucien felt rage building alongside terror. "You're a—"
"Monster?" Valthor supplied helpfully. "Yes. I am. I've never pretended otherwise." He shifted again, this time the movement clearly painful. "Now. Shall we discuss why you're really here?"
Tharion stepped forward, shadows writhing despite the weight of Valthor's presence. "The original Pact was flawed. Built on manipulation."
"Oh?" Valthor's tone was amused. Dangerous. "Do tell. Enlighten the dying dragon about the Pact that has slowly consumed him for two hundred years. I'm certain you children know more than I do."
"You were Shadeweave-convinced," Lucien said carefully. "Made to believe exile was your choice. Your victory. But it wasn't. You were manipulated into accepting terms you would have rejected otherwise."
Silence.
Then Valthor laughed—a sound like mountains crumbling that echoed through the chamber until Mira had to shield them with spirit-light just to keep their eardrums from bursting.
"You think I don't KNOW?" The dragon's voice dropped to something that made the air vibrate. "You think two centuries of slow death haven't taught me the taste of Shade-worked compulsion?"
He rose slightly, and suddenly they could see just how massive he truly was. The platform wasn't a throne. It was barely large enough to contain him.
"I knew within decades. The serene acceptance that felt imposed rather than earned. The way my rage at confinement would quiet too easily, too perfectly." His eyes gleamed like molten bronze. "The way I could feel something feeding on my life force. Slowly. Inexorably. Deliciously."
Liora's voice was barely audible. "You knew. And you didn't break it."
"No." Valthor settled back down, each movement deliberate. "I didn't. Because unlike you children, I understand arithmetic."
He was quiet for a moment, and in that silence they could hear his breathing—labored, painful, the sound of something that should have died years ago.
"I've had two centuries to think," Valthor said. "To plan. To consider options." His claws scraped against obsidian. "I could break the Pact. Even dying, even drained, I have enough strength left for that. And once free, I could reclaim what was mine."
His eyes swept the chamber.
"I would burn through your defenses like parchment. Crush Aurelián. Reclaim dominance over humanity within months. You are weak now. Soft. Two hundred years without dragons has made you forget what real predators look like."
He leaned forward again, and this time none of them could suppress the flinch.
"I would win. Make no mistake about that."
Pause.
"But then I would die. Because the Pact breaking doesn't stop the drain—it just removes the cage. I'd have perhaps weeks. A month if I'm lucky. And then..." His voice went flat. "Then my son wakes."
The temperature dropped further.
"Varkoth," Valthor continued, "is everything I was at my prime, but without the centuries of warfare that taught me when to stop. When to consolidate. When to show mercy because dead subjects can't pay tribute."
"He doesn't stop. He doesn't negotiate. He doesn't accept surrender." The dragon's voice carried something that might have been fear, might have been pride. "He burns until there's nothing left. Until the world is ash and bone and silence."
"Not just humanity," he added quietly. "Everything. He'd scorch Dravaryn itself trying to prove his dominance. Burn the forests. Poison the rivers. Crack the mountains. And when the world died..."
"Dragons die too," Brenn whispered.
"Dragons die too," Valthor agreed. "We are creatures of magic. Of life-force. Of the world's pulse. Kill the world, and we follow within decades. Starving. Withering. Fading."
He looked at each of them in turn.
"So that's my arithmetic. Break free and win, then die while my son destroys the world and dooms our entire race. Or..." He gestured weakly. "...stay in my cage and hope someone comes along with a better solution."
Silence stretched.
"You're not being noble," Kaelen said slowly. "You're being pragmatic."
"I'm being a dragon," Valthor corrected. "We're survival above all else. And surviving means not unleashing the extinction of my own kind." His tone went colder. "Don't mistake this for mercy. Given any other option, I would burn you all and dance in the ashes. But I don't have other options. So here we are."
Lucien stepped closer, radiant light flickering in his palms. "We're here to offer you that better solution."
"And what solution would that be?"
"We remake the Pact," Tharion said. "Properly. Built on seven disciplines instead of four. Stable, sustainable, honest."
"You bind me anyway," Valthor said flatly. "Just with better magic."
"Yes," Lucien admitted. "But we do it transparently. We connect you to Dravaryn's flow instead of draining you. We give you life instead of taking it. And we're honest about why."
He met those ancient, hungry eyes.
"You're dangerous. You've proven that. You would resume conquest if freed—you've said so yourself. So we bind you. Not because we trick you. Because humanity has the right to survive, and you've proven you would take that right away."
Silence stretched.
"You want me to consent," Valthor said slowly, "to captivity."
"We want you to acknowledge what's necessary," Liora corrected quietly. "The old Pact lied and said you chose exile. The new Pact says: you are bound because you must be, but you will be bound fairly."
Valthor studied them for a long moment. Then his gaze fixed on Lucien, and there was something calculating in those ancient eyes.
"Show me this binding of yours. But know this—I will test it. I will test you. And if your Sevenfold cannot hold a dying dragon, it certainly won't hold my son."

They formed the circle.
Seven points around the obsidian platform. Lucien at north—Radiance. Tharion at northeast—Shadeweave. Liora at east—Rune. Sienna at southeast—Flame. Brenn at south—Earth. Mira at southwest—Spirit.
And at west, where the seventh node should be, Lucien placed his hand flat against the stone and reached for the pulse of the world itself.
Valeria, Gavren, Selara, and Veyric took positions at the cardinal points between—guardians, defenders, witnesses.
"The Sevenfold requires balance," Lucien said, voice carrying through the chamber. "Each discipline in harmony. Each thread equal. No domination. No extraction."
His radiant light flared. "I am Radiance. I illuminate what was hidden. I burn away deception."
Tharion's shadows coiled. "I am Shadeweave. I reveal what lurks beneath. I show truth even darkness carries."
Liora's runes sparked to life. "I am Rune. I inscribe meaning. I make permanence from intention."
Sienna's flames roared higher. "I am Flame. I transform. I purify. I forge new from old."
Brenn's earth-light pulsed. "I am Earth. I anchor. I sustain. I make foundation."
Mira's spirits swirled. "I am Spirit. I connect. I bridge. I weave what's separate into whole."
And from the west, where Lucien's hand pressed against stone, came a pulse—not from him, but through him. The world itself responding.
"Dravaryn," Lucien breathed. "The seventh node. Not person but place. Not taker but giver. The world's flow that sustains all life."
The ley-lines in the chamber walls flared brilliant.
"You're connecting me," Valthor said slowly, "to the world itself."
"Yes." Lucien's voice shook with the power flowing through him. "Not extracting from you. Connecting you TO everything. You'll be bound to the Elder Peaks, yes. But you'll feel the world's pulse. Be part of its rhythm. Sustained by what sustains all things."
"Begin," Valthor commanded. "And let's see if children can cage a dragon properly."
The Sevenfold activated.
Lucien felt it first—his radiant light pouring outward, connecting to Tharion's shadows, weaving with Liora's runes, amplified by Sienna's flames, anchored by Brenn's earth, bridged by Mira's spirits.
Six threads becoming seven as the world's pulse joined them.
The power began to flow through the circle, around it, reaching toward Valthor—
And the dragon pushed back.
Not breaking the working. Testing it. His will slammed against the Sevenfold like a battering ram against castle walls.
"HOLD!" Valeria shouted.
Lucien gritted his teeth, pouring more radiant light into the weaving. Beside him, he felt the Pack straining—Tharion's shadows flickering, Liora's runes cracking at the edges, Sienna's flames guttering.
"IS THIS ALL?" Valthor's voice boomed. "IS THIS YOUR MIGHTY SEVENFOLD?"
He pushed harder. The circle buckled.
Through the bond, Lucien felt Mira faltering. Felt Brenn's foundation cracking. Felt—
No.
"TOGETHER!" Lucien shouted, and through the Pack bond he sent everything—his faith in them, his trust, his absolute certainty that they could hold.
And the Pack responded.
Not as seven individuals. As one organism. Seven threads that wove together so tightly they became unbreakable.
The Sevenfold stabilized. Strengthened. And when Valthor pushed again, it didn't buckle.
It held.
"Better," the dragon said, and there was approval in his tone. "Much better. Very well. You've proven the binding can hold even when I resist."
His voice shifted, taking on a formal quality that resonated through the chamber.
"I, Valthor, Patriarch of the Bronze Flight, speaker for all dragons of the Elder Peaks, do hereby give my consent to this binding."
The words carried weight—magical, binding weight.
"I acknowledge that I am dangerous. That I would resume conquest if freed. That humanity has the right to defend itself from what I would do." His eyes gleamed. "I consent not because I wish captivity, but because I acknowledge necessity."
The Sevenfold pulsed, accepting the formal consent.
"Furthermore," Valthor continued, "I bind not only myself but all dragons under my authority. This Pact speaks for my entire Flight. When the others wake, they wake into this binding. Let it be known: this is not just my cage. It is ours. All of us. By my word as Patriarch."
The power shifted, expanding. The binding wasn't just wrapping around Valthor—it was spreading, connecting to the ley-lines that would reach every dragon in the Elder Peaks.
"I consent," Valthor said again, the words echoing. "Let the Sevenfold be witnessed. Let it be sealed. Let it be permanent."
The binding locked into place.
And then the flow reversed. Where the old Pact had slowly consumed him, the new one filled him. Connected him to the pulse of Dravaryn itself—not taking, but giving. He was part of the world's rhythm now, bound to it, sustained by it.
Valthor gasped—a sound of surprise mixed with something that might have been relief.
"I can..." His voice was wonder mixed with his usual menace. "I can feel it. The world. Dravaryn's heartbeat. The pulse of every living thing."
They could all see it—his scales brightening, the dulled bronze catching light and throwing it back like polished metal. His breathing came easier. The pain in his movements lessening. The tears in his wing membranes beginning to knit.
Healing. Not instantly, but visibly. The connection to Dravaryn's flow doing what two centuries of extraction never could—sustaining him properly.
"How long?" Valthor's voice was stronger now, no longer labored. "How long will this hold?"
"Forever," Tharion said. "As long as the world pulses, you're connected to it. As long as you remain in the Elder Peaks, the binding sustains you."
"And I cannot leave."
"No."
Valthor rose—fully rose for the first time since they'd entered—and the sheer scale of him made them all step back instinctively. His wings spread, membranes already healing, and the span was wide enough to cast the entire chamber in shadow.
He looked alive again. Dangerous. Magnificent. Terrible.
"Then you've succeeded where Thorne failed. You've bound me properly." He folded his wings back, settling into a position that looked almost comfortable. "Not with lies. With honest necessity."
He looked at each of them in turn, and there was respect in that gaze now. Hard-won, grudging, but real.
"This is better. I won't pretend gratitude. I won't thank you for my cage. I am a monster, and monsters do not give thanks." He paused. "But it's fair. And fairness from prey to predator? That's... unexpected."
The Sevenfold pulsed one final time, sealing completely.
And then quiet.
Just twelve people breathing hard in a chamber that hummed with power and a dragon who looked at them with ancient eyes that finally held something other than hunger.
"It's done," Valeria said softly.
They'd done it. Forged a Pact built on truth instead of lies. Bound not just one dragon but an entire Flight—not through deception but through transparent necessity.
The kingdom was safe. The dragons would remain in exile—but fairly. Honestly. Sustainably.
It was everything they'd worked for.
So why did Lucien feel hollow?

"You should go," Valthor said after a long moment. "Your kingdom awaits its heroes." He shifted slightly, testing his newfound strength. "Though I imagine you care more about one ancestral estate than all the cheering masses."
His eyes gleamed with dark amusement. "Did the vaults hold, I wonder? Did your parents survive my message? Or did I miscalculate and give you tragedy instead of motivation?"
Lucien's hands clenched, radiant light flickering.
"Easy," Valthor said, voice carrying warning. "You've bound me fairly. Don't give me reason to test those bonds by threatening my binder."
"You burned my home."
"I motivated you to save the world," Valthor corrected. "The fact that your home was the most efficient lever? That's just good strategy." He tilted his head. "Would you rather I'd targeted a random village? Burned peasants instead of nobles? At least your family had stone vaults and warning."
"That doesn't—"
"No, it doesn't justify it," Valthor agreed. "I'm a monster. I've never pretended otherwise. But I'm a monster who just consented to eternal captivity to save my race and yours. So perhaps we call it even and you go find out if your parents survived."
He settled more comfortably, and they could all see how much better he looked already—scales gleaming, eyes bright, movements no longer pained.
"Will you..." Mira hesitated. "Will you tell the other dragons? When they wake?"
"I will tell them the truth." Valthor's gaze was distant now, focused inward on the connection he could feel to Dravaryn's pulse. "That humanity bound us fairly. That we are contained not through lies but through honest acknowledgment of what we are." His voice dropped. "And I will tell them that this—connection instead of extraction—is better than what we had."
"Will they accept it?" Kaelen asked.
"Some will. Some won't." Valthor shifted, testing his wings again. They moved smoothly now, powerful, deadly. "But they will know the terms. No deception. Just necessity made honest. And they will feel what I feel—the world's pulse sustaining them instead of the slow drain killing them."
He looked directly at Lucien.
"The god who stole you. Aeloran. He told you that you were needed. That the kingdom would fall without you."
"Yes."
"And you were," Valthor said simply. "Your power made this possible. Your Pack made this stable. Your presence made the difference." His eyes gleamed. "Does that justify the theft?"
"No."
"Good." Valthor's tone carried something that might have been approval. "Then you understand: necessity doesn't erase violation. Just because I SHOULD be bound doesn't mean Thorne had the RIGHT to lie to me." He paused, letting the words sink in. "Just because you WERE needed doesn't mean Aeloran had the right to steal you."
The parallel hit like a physical blow.
"I spent two centuries bound by lies," Valthor continued. "Dying slowly, knowing I was manipulated, unable to break free without dooming my entire race. You think I don't understand what it means to be trapped by someone else's necessity?"
He leaned forward slightly, and his voice went quiet, intense.
"Demand what I demanded. Acknowledgment. Honesty. And then make them do it right. No more lies. No more theft disguised as necessity." His eyes burned. "You gave me fair binding. Demand fair treatment in return. And if they refuse?"
He bared his teeth in what might have been a smile.
"Then burn them. Like I would."
Lucien nodded, throat tight.
"Now go," Valthor said, settling back. "Find out if your parents live. And when you face your god, remember: even monsters deserve honest cages."
They turned to leave.
"Young Alaris," Valthor called.
Lucien looked back.
"If the vaults didn't hold..." The dragon's voice was surprisingly gentle. "...then I miscalculated. And even monsters can make errors." A pause. "It wasn't personal. Just strategy. But that doesn't un-burn a home."
It wasn't an apology. Valthor was incapable of apology.
But it was... acknowledgment. In his own terrible way.
Lucien left the dragon to his honest captivity—bound fairly, sustained properly, connected to the world's pulse and more dangerous than ever but contained.
The Pact would hold. The kingdom was safe.
But as they descended from the Elder Peaks, all Lucien could think about was smoke rising in the west.
And parents who might already be ash.

The descent was faster than the climb—gravity and urgency both pulling them downward. But not fast enough. Never fast enough.
They pushed through the initial mountain passes at a near-run despite exhaustion, camping only when darkness made the paths too treacherous. The Ashen Flats were crossed at a brutal pace, Valeria driving them forward until even Brenn was breathing hard. No wurms rose to challenge them this time—the ley-lines hummed with new power, and even the simplest creatures could sense that something fundamental had changed.
The Thornwood felt different when they entered it. Quieter. More settled. The displaced creatures had either found new territories or died trying, and the normal rhythms of the wild were slowly returning. They made good time through the ancient oaks, emerging onto the rolling hills with three days of travel behind them.
Villages were appearing from hiding now, people venturing cautiously into fields. Word was spreading—the Pact was renewed, the dragons would remain in exile. Humanity was safe. They passed refugees heading home, merchants resuming trade routes, life cautiously returning to normal.
But every mile closer meant Lucien's tension ratcheted higher. What would they find? The scouts had said the fires were contained, the dragon had retreated. But "contained" didn't mean his parents had survived.
On the fourth day, within sight of Aurelián Spire, a rider approached from the west. From Alaris lands.
Lucien's heart stopped.
The rider was clean, unhurried. Not the desperate bearing of someone fleeing tragedy. That had to mean something. It had to.
"Lord Alaris," the rider called, pulling up beside them. "Highmaster Valthorne sent word you'd be arriving. I was dispatched from your family's estates with a report."
"My parents," Lucien said, voice raw from days of not knowing. "Are they—"
"Alive, my lord." The rider's expression was grave but not sorrowful. "Lord Theron and Lady Sera both survived. The stone vaults held, though the main house..." He hesitated. "The main house was lost. The fires consumed most of the upper structure before our reinforcements arrived. But the family and most of the staff made it to safety."
The world tilted. Lucien felt his knees buckle, felt Ralen's hand catch his shoulder.
Alive. They're alive.
Through the Pack bond, he felt their collective relief crash over him like a wave—Mira's quiet joy, Sienna's fierce satisfaction, Kaelen's steadying presence.
"The estates?" Valeria asked quietly.
"Damaged but salvageable. The dragon's attack was... precise. It burned specific structures—the main house, the barns, some outlying buildings. But it avoided the villages, the tenant farms, the areas where people would have been trapped." The rider's tone was puzzled. "Almost like it was sending a message rather than trying to kill."
"It was," Lucien said hollowly. Because Valthor had told them as much. Motivation, not murder. Strategy, not slaughter.
Still monstrous. Still unforgivable. But calculated.
"Your parents have relocated to the summer residence while repairs are planned," the rider continued. "They... they asked me to tell you that you should return to the Spire first. Complete your duties as hero of the kingdom." A pause. "They said the family matters can wait until the kingdom has celebrated its saviors."
Even now. Even after everything. They were thinking of duty before family.
Or maybe they just needed time. Time to process that their son was coming home victorious. Time to prepare for whatever conversations waited.
"Thank you," Lucien managed. "Tell them... tell them I'll come as soon as I can."
The rider nodded and continued south.
They stood on the road, the Spire visible ahead, and Lucien finally let himself breathe.
His parents were alive. The house was gone, but the people remained. There would be time for explanations. Time for truth. Time to see if they could rebuild a relationship on honest foundations instead of divine lies.
"Come on," Valeria said gently. "The Spire awaits."
They entered Aurelián to cheers.

Students lined the courtyards, masters stood in formal recognition. Word had spread—they'd succeeded. Saved the kingdom. Forged a Pact that would hold for centuries.
Heroes, all of them.
Lucien felt it wash over him like water off stone. The celebrations, the recognition, the gratitude of an entire kingdom—it all felt distant. Hollow.
He'd saved everyone. But the cost had been his home, his certainty, his parents' peace.
Victory, yes. But bought with what price?
Valthorne met them at the gates, crystalline staff gleaming. "Well done. All of you. The kingdom owes you a debt it can never repay."
"The Pact holds," Valeria reported. "Valthor consented. The binding is stable. All dragons of the Elder Peaks are now bound fairly and sustainably."
"I felt it through the ley-lines," Valthorne said, and there was wonder in his voice. "A Sevenfold binding, connected to Dravaryn itself. Elegant. Powerful. Just."
His gaze swept across all of them—the Pack who had woven the ritual, Valeria who had guarded them, and the three Draemir retainers who had fought beside them.
When his eyes found Tharion, he paused. Held the young lord's gaze for a long moment. Then nodded—once, deliberate, weighted with recognition.
House Draemir had stood at the forging of a Pact built on truth. Had chosen transparency over manipulation, honest binding over Shadeweave deception.
Perhaps that was redemption enough.
Tharion's shoulders straightened slightly, and he returned the nod.
Valthorne's attention shifted to Lucien. "You've done what Thorne Alaris could not. You've forged something that will last not through deception, but through truth."
Lucien nodded numbly. "My parents?"
"Are safe. The rider found you, then?"
"Yes."
"Good." Valthorne's expression softened. "Rest tonight. Recover. And then..." He paused. "Then you go home. To family. To whatever conversations wait there."
Lucien hesitated, then spoke. "Valthor... he knew. About the manipulation. The Shadeweave. He figured it out within decades."
Valthorne's expression shifted. "And he didn't break it."
"No. He said..." Lucien chose his words carefully. "He said it wasn't noble. He was being pragmatic. Survival above all else. Breaking free meant winning temporarily, then dying while his son destroyed the world and doomed dragonkind with it." He met Valthorne's eyes. "He stayed in the cage because the alternative was extinction for his entire race."
Valthorne was quiet for a long moment, leaning heavily on his crystalline staff.
"And what did he say," the Highmaster asked softly, "about what Thorne did?"
"That necessity doesn't erase violation. That just because he should be bound doesn't mean Thorne had the right to lie to him." Lucien's voice was steady. "But he also said... he said Thorne was smarter than he'd given him credit for. That he did what was necessary when there were no good options."
"No good options," Valthorne repeated, and something in his voice broke slightly. "Thorne wrote that in his journals. Over and over. 'There were no good options.' I always wondered if he was trying to convince himself or if he truly believed it."
He looked up at the Spire, at the home Thorne's ancestor had built, had bled for, had compromised his principles to defend.
"Thank you," Valthorne said quietly. "For telling me. For... for giving him something that wasn't quite forgiveness, but wasn't quite damnation either." He straightened. "Thorne Alaris did what he had to do. And he hated himself for it. Perhaps that's all any of us can ask—to do what's necessary and carry the weight of it honestly."
He looked at all of them then, at twelve young people who had just forged something better than their ancestors could manage.
"You gave Valthor what Thorne couldn't. An honest cage. Perhaps that redeems both of them, in the end."

The Pack surrounded him—not speaking, not offering hollow comfort. Just there. Present. Solid.
His family. Built by choice, proven in fire, bound by something stronger than blood.
And somewhere to the west, in a summer residence surrounded by ash and rebuilding, his parents waited.
The people who'd raised him for twelve years without knowing he wasn't theirs.
The people who deserved to know the truth. All of it.
The people who would decide, with full knowledge this time, whether they still wanted to call him son.
Evening fell. The celebrations continued around them—the Spire rejoicing in salvation—but the Pack sat together in quiet reflection.
His parents were alive. The house was gone, but the people remained. There would be time for explanations. Time for truth. Time to see if they could rebuild a relationship on honest foundations instead of divine lies.
But that was for tomorrow. For the days after.
Tonight, they were together—twelve people who had walked into shadow and emerged carrying light.
Lucien stared west, toward rebuilding and uncertain reunions, and wondered what would come next.
The Pact was forged. The kingdom saved. His parents alive.
But the real reckonings—with parents, with gods, with the theft that started it all—those still waited in the shadow of what came next.
