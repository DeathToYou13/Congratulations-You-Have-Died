Chapter 23 – The Law of Consent

I couldn’t sleep.
Tomorrow we’d travel to the Elder Peaks—into dragon territory, to the convergence where ley-lines ran thick enough to sustain the Sevenfold Weave. We’d attempt the impossible: forge a new Pact at Valthor’s chamber using a structure that had never been tested. Seven nodes working in perfect harmony, none dominant, all equal.
And I’d be one of those seven nodes. The Radiant conduit.
The weight of it sat heavy in my chest. Not fear of the journey, exactly. Not even fear of facing a dying dragon. More like … the sense that I was missing something. That there was a piece of this puzzle I hadn’t found yet.
So I did what I always did when the weight got too heavy—I went to the Archive.
The Sunlit Archive was quiet at night, its floating mana-lamps dimmed to soft gold. I’d been coming here every evening since Valthorne granted us access, losing myself in centuries of Alaris history. Looking for … what? Answers? Absolution? Proof that what we were about to do was right?
Tonight, I found something else.
Liora had been organizing the Archive systematically, cataloging texts and cross-referencing dates. She’d found a sealed section behind a false panel—pre-Thorne-era documents preserved in stasis wards. I wasn’t supposed to be reading them yet. She wanted to analyze them first, build a timeline, understand the context. But I couldn’t help myself.
One tome sat apart from the others. Smaller. Older. Bound in leather that felt wrong somehow—too smooth, too warm, like it was alive. The title was burned into the cover in script that made my head hurt to read:
Divine Interventions: The Alaris Bloodline
My hands shook as I opened it.
It is known among the initiated that the gods of Dravaryn rarely intervene directly in mortal affairs. The cost is too great—divine action creates ripples, debts that must be paid across centuries. This tome records the two times Aeloran, god of Dravaryn, chose to intervene in the fate of House Alaris.
I read about the First Intervention. Eight centuries ago. The amplification of spiritual capacity. Elarion Alaris accepting divine enhancement to fight dragons. Six centuries of his descendants paying that cost. Then the Mortal Pact: King Thorne ending the war two centuries ago, sealing the Alaris spiritual capacity. The radiant affinity remaining dormant without the power to fuel it. Standard history. Nothing I didn’t know. Then I reached the sealed section.
Second Intervention – Twelve Years Ago: The Replacement
This entry is sealed by divine command and divine law. To be opened only when the one it concerns reaches the age of choice and discovers the truth of their existence. If you are reading this, the seals have recognized you as ready.
My breath caught. The next page glowed faintly, responding to my touch.
Twelve years ago, Aeloran foresaw the Pact’s failure. The Dragon Patriarch Valthor was dying. When his death came, the Pact would dissolve. Dragons would return to a kingdom with no defense—the Alaris spiritual capacity sealed, locked by Thorne’s agreement, inaccessible until the Pact itself broke. But if the Pact broke, dragons would return immediately. There would be no time to unseal what Thorne locked. The kingdom would fall. Aeloran required a solution outside the Pact’s jurisdiction entirely.
My hands went numb. I kept reading.
From a world called Earth—a mana desert incapable of sustaining divine presence—Aeloran found a soul with legendary spiritual capacity dormant within it. A man named Ethan Daniels, age thirty-five. His spiritual reserves, useless in Earth’s magicless environment, measured as legendary potential when translated to Dravaryn’s framework. Here was the solution: spiritual capacity that existed outside the Pact’s binding. Foreign power that could fuel the Alaris radiant affinity without touching the sealed bloodline reserves.
The tome slipped through my fingers and clattered on stone. Ethan Daniels. That was me. Not a past life. Not a reincarnation. Me.
Under divine law, such theft is forbidden—a soul’s spiritual capacity is sovereign, not to be taken without consent. But Earth exists beyond divine protection, a realm abandoned by its gods or perhaps never claimed by any. In that lawless void, divine law cannot be enforced. The theft, while technically illegal, went unpunished because there was no authority to challenge it.
I couldn’t breathe. The words swam. I forced myself to keep reading.
Aeloran made the exchange. Ethan Daniels’s soul was extracted from its host body and implanted into an Alaris infant—Lucien, son of Theron and Sera—who would have been stillborn without intervention. The Earth-body was left soulless.
Left soulless. Not dead. Left.
The transplanted soul retained its memories—necessary to preserve the spiritual capacity’s integrity across universes. Seven years later, when the soul touched a mana-conductor, it awakened the natural Alaris radiant affinity present in the bloodline—fueled by Earth-soul spiritual capacity instead of the sealed Alaris reserves. The affinity manifested because the power source was foreign, unbound by the Pact’s restrictions. This was Aeloran’s second intervention: not restoring what was sealed, but replacing it with stolen equivalence.
The Archive spun. Or maybe I was falling. I couldn’t tell. Stolen equivalence. I wasn’t Lucien Alaris brought back to life. I was Ethan Daniels. Ripped from my body. Shoved into a corpse. Told I’d died when I’d been murdered.
Divine law is absolute in one regard: stolen spiritual capacity requires informed consent to activate fully. This tome exists to fulfill that requirement.
By reading these words you have been informed. Your soul was stolen to power the Alaris affinity. Now you must choose.
Liora's hands shook as she turned the page, her voice dropping to a horrified whisper. "Ethan, there's more."
"However," she read, "divine law acknowledges that consent obtained through engineered circumstances—where refusal would result in the death or suffering of valued companions—is considered valid, though morally... questionable."
She looked up at me, face pale. "The text describes a 'cultivation of attachment' protocol. Creating bonds. Placing those bonds in danger. Forcing escalating power usage to save them. Until the subject has no choice but to consent to full activation or watch everyone they love die."
My blood turned to ice.
"Ethan." Her voice cracked. "The trials. Kaelen nearly dying. Mira's Veil breach. Every time you pushed your power to save them—"
"It was a setup," I finished, bile rising in my throat. "He put them in danger. So I'd need more power. So I'd eventually have to consent or let them die."
The System had been measuring my bonds. Tracking their strength.
Loyalty Threshold -- SUFFICIENT.
Not sufficient for friendship. Sufficient for leverage.
"There's one more thing," Liora whispered, tears streaming down her face. She pointed to a final passage:
"The Earth-vessel remains in its world, soulless but living. Medical intervention will sustain basic functions indefinitely. The family will mourn. This is acceptable collateral for the greater purpose. Divine law permits such sacrifice from abandoned realms."
I thought of my parents. My friends, maybe. Someone who loved Ethan Daniels and was watching his body breathe through machines, waiting for him to wake up.
Waiting forever.
And Aeloran called it "acceptable collateral."
The room tilted. My vision narrowed to the words on the page.
By reading these words, you have been informed: your soul is from Earth. Your spiritual capacity was stolen to provide power for Alaris radiant affinity. You exist as divine theft, taken to solve the crisis of a failing Pact. Now you must choose.
Do you consent to full activation of your stolen spiritual capacity—your legendary reserves, ripped from Earth—to fuel the Alaris magic and serve whatever purpose this kingdom requires? Or do you refuse, keeping your capacity locked at threshold levels?
Currently your spiritual capacity operates at 23%—threshold activation, enough to manifest the Alaris affinity but insufficient to serve as anchor for large-scale workings. Full activation requires your willing, informed consent.
[System Alert: CONSENT VERIFICATION REQUIRED]                                                       [System Alert: Legendary Spiritual Capacity – LOCKED pending informed consent]                                                                                                                  [System Alert: Current Activation: 23% (Threshold Manifestation)]      [System Alert: Full Activation Requires: WILLING CONSENT]
The alerts. The system. The cheerful “Congratulations! You have died!” All of it was a lie.
If you are reading this, Lucien Alaris—or should we call you Ethan Daniels?—know this: your soul was stolen. Your spiritual capacity was taken without permission. But your choice is your own. Divine law demands it. This is the one freedom Aeloran could not steal: your right to say no.
The book fell from my hands. I stood there in the Archive’s golden light, and the truth crashed over me in waves.
I didn’t die. On Earth—my Earth, my world, my life—there was a body. Ethan Daniels’s body. Thirty-five years old. In a hospital somewhere. Machines breathing for lungs that forgot how. Brain-dead. Vegetative. Because Aeloran ripped my soul out.
Did I have family? A wife? Kids? Friends who visited less and less because it had been twelve years and there was no one home behind my eyes? How long did they wait before they stopped hoping?
And I’d been here. Living. Laughing. Building friendships. Thinking I’d been given a gift. All while my body rotted in a hospital bed and my family grieved.
“No.” The word came out broken. “No, no, no—”
Every memory of the past twelve years curdled. My seventh birthday when the magic awakened—that wasn’t a miracle. That was the theft activating. The stolen power recognizing its new prison.
My parents’ love—they were loving a corpse piloted by a stolen soul. Their real son died before he drew breath.
The Pack—I'd built everything with them on a foundation of murder.
“I didn’t die,” I whispered. “I was murdered.”
The golden light of the Archive felt wrong now. Sinister. Like I was standing in the belly of the beast that had devoured me.
Aeloran needed a tool. And Earth had no gods to stop him from taking one.
The system’s message echoed in my skull: “Congratulations! You have died!”
Liar. Murderer. Thief.
Something inside me snapped.
The scream that tore from my throat wasn’t human. It was the sound of a soul realizing it had been caged for twelve years. That every moment of joy was stolen. That consent meant nothing when the alternative was unconscionable.
Golden light erupted from my chest—not controlled, not intentional, just agony made manifest. The Archive’s wards shrieked. Shelves cracked. Ancient tomes tumbled as the walls themselves trembled.
I didn’t care. Let it all burn. Let the Spire fall. Let the kingdom crumble. I wasn’t Lucien Alaris. I wasn’t anyone. I was a ghost piloting a corpse, and I wanted to stop existing.
Somewhere in the dormitory, Mira jolted awake. The bond—their connection to me—was screaming. Not pain. Worse. Despair. Absolute. Bottomless. She ran. The Pack ran. Through corridors still humming with residual golden light, following the bond like a lifeline back to someone who was drowning.
They found me on the floor. The tome lay open beside me, its pages glowing with that sickening cheerful light. The Archive’s wards were fractured, leaking mana like blood from a wound. I was kneeling, shaking, light pouring from my skin in waves that had no rhythm, no control.
“Ethan?” Ralen’s voice was careful, the way you’d speak to something wounded and cornered. I couldn’t answer. Couldn’t form words.
“What happened?” Sienna whispered. Liora had already picked up the tome. Her eyes scanned the pages, and the color drained from her face. “Oh gods. Lucien—” “Don’t call me that.” My voice was ruined. “That’s not my name.”
Mira knelt before me, her wisp hovering close. “We’re here,” she said. “Whatever it is, we’re here.”
“You shouldn’t be.” I laughed jaggedly. “I’m not real. None of this is real. I’m a stolen soul in a corpse and everything I’ve built with you is wrong—”
“Stop.” Kaelen’s voice cut through, raw and fierce. “I don’t care where your soul came from. You’re my pack. That’s real.”
The others closed around me then. Each spoke their truth. Ralen’s steadfast strength. Mira’s gentle faith. Kaelen’s loyalty, Sienna’s fire, Brenn’s grounded calm, Liora’s shattered logic. They anchored me to something solid when everything else felt like lies.
They asked me to choose them anyway.
Their hands on me, their bond around me, they became the reason I could finally breathe.
I promised them that if I ever found a way back to Earth, I’d go. And if I ever wanted to walk away, they’d let me. Even if it cost them. They agreed. They understood.
That made it real.
I placed my hand on the final page.
“I, Ethan Daniels, give informed consent for the full activation of my stolen spiritual capacity.”
The words left my mouth, and I froze.
Ethan Daniels.
My Earth name. The name I'd carried for thirty-five years in a gray world of cubicles and coffee breaks.
The name my parents had "chosen" for my cover identity. A common name, they'd said. Nothing special. Just happened to fit.
My hands started shaking.
There are no coincidences with gods.
Aeloran had known my Earth name. Had whispered it to my parents in dreams, maybe. Guided them to choose it. Made sure that when I answered to "Ethan Daniels" at Aurelián, I was answering to my TRUE name—the one tied to my stolen soul.
Even my mask was part of the design.
Every time I introduced myself, every time I signed my name, every time someone called me "Ethan"—I was reinforcing the connection between my Earth-soul and Lucien's body.
Making the theft more complete.
"Oh god," I whispered. "Even that. Even my name."
Kaelen's grip tightened on my shoulder. "What? What about your name?"
But I couldn't answer. Could barely breathe.
Nothing had been mine. Not my choice of stats. Not my awakening. Not my trials. Not even my fucking name.
The Pack tightened around me as light flared.
[System Alert: Consent verified.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   [System Alert: Divine Safeguard C-23 unlocking…]                                                                                                         [System Alert: Spiritual capacity seal disengaged.]                                                          [System Alert: Legendary reserves initializing: 23% → 44% → 65% → 86% → 100%]

Power roared through me. For twelve years I’d lived at a fraction of myself. This was freedom and pain bound together. The Pack moved as one—Mira’s wisp absorbing overflow, Sienna’s flame tempering, Brenn anchoring, Ralen steady, Kaelen and Liora stabilizing—until the light finally settled. Then the final alerts came.
[System Alert: PRIMARY OBJECTIVE COMPLETE] [System Alert: CONSENT STATUS -- WILLING AND INFORMED] [System Alert: CAPACITY LIMITATION REMOVED] [System Alert: MONITORING PROTOCOL NO LONGER REQUIRED] [System Alert: Thank you for your cooperation, Ethan Daniels.] [System Alert: May your service honor the sacrifice made in your name.] [System Alert: SHUTTING DOWN …]
The silence in my head was absolute. For the first time in this life no chimes, no tracking, no guidance. The warden had left. Its job was done. I’d been measured, manipulated, and deemed sufficient. And it thanked me for cooperating. Silence.
The system that had been with me since childhood was gone. The truth hit like ice. It had never guided me—it had measured me. Every stat, every level up, every quest was a cage disguised as praise. I told them.
They listened.
They understood.
And when the rage ebbed, there was only quiet. Kaelen broke it first. “Good,” he said. “Good that it’s gone. Now we can do whatever we want.” Ralen nodded. “For twelve years you were caged. You still became you.” Sienna’s voice burned. “No more limits. No more oversight. Just you.” They were right. The system was gone. The warden had left. But they remained. For the first time in twelve years I could think without being measured. Choose without being watched.
It should have felt liberating. Instead it felt like mourning. At least now I knew. At least now I was free.
And when I chose them, it would be completely, utterly mine. No system to measure it. No god to approve it.
Just me. As dawn broke, we left the Archive together. Tharion was waiting in the corridor, eyes shadowed and alert, like someone who’d run here the moment the wards tremored. He straightened when he saw us but didn’t step in our path. “I… felt something,” he said quietly. “The whole lower ring shook. I wasn’t sure if—”
He stopped himself. His gaze flicked over the Pack, taking in the exhaustion, the bruises, the way they stayed gathered close around me. “I just wanted to make sure you were alive.” “I am,” I said. Relief softened the line of his shoulders. “Good.” He didn’t ask what happened. Didn’t demand answers. Whatever he’d expected to find here, it wasn’t something he felt entitled to pry into. “You don’t have to explain anything,” he added, voice low. “I just… didn’t want you walking out to an empty hall.” For a moment we just stood there, two boys linked by things neither of us had language for. “Thank you,” I said. Tharion nodded once—sharp, almost awkward. “We leave for the Elder Peaks at first light. I’ll see you there.” “I’ll be there.” He stepped aside, letting us pass. I looked at my Pack—exhausted, scared, but still standing with me. “Thank you,” I said. “For not letting me drown.” Mira’s wisp pulsed warmly. “That’s what packs do.” Tomorrow we would travel to the Elder Peaks with full legendary power coursing through me—stolen from Earth, locked by divine law for twelve years, freed by my choice. I didn’t know if it would matter.
Didn’t know if the Sevenfold would work.
But I knew one thing: Whatever happened in Valthor’s chamber, I’d face it as myself—Ethan Daniels wearing Lucien Alaris’s face, carrying stolen power, bound to a Pack that chose me despite everything. I lay in bed as dawn approached, staring at the ceiling. The Pack knew what I was. They’d chosen me anyway. But my parents had ridden away this morning still calling me Lucien. I closed my eyes against the thought and tried to sleep. Tomorrow, the Elder Peaks. Everything else could wait.
