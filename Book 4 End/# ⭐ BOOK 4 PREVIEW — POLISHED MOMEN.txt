# **1. Late Night in the Archive — “Five More Minutes”**

Dust motes drifting through lamplight.
The Archive silent except for scratching quills and the low hum of resonance generators.

Liora hunched over a stack of codices—hair falling in front of her face, rune-light flickering across her fingers.

Tharion on the opposite side of the table, shadows moving like patient animals around his boots.

**Liora**: *muttering* “The spike on the seventh harmonic suggests—”

**Tharion**: *without looking up* “—interference from the containment field unless we offset the shadow-drift by a factor of four.”

She freezes.
Looks up slowly.

**Liora**: “How did you—”

**Tharion**: *finally looks at her* “I was reading the same section. You annotate when you're thinking. Tiny marks in the top-right corner. You do it unconsciously.”

Beat.

**Liora**: *soft* “You noticed that.”

**Tharion**: “I notice a lot of things about you.”

The silence is sudden and delicate, as if the Archive itself is holding its breath.

**Liora**: “We should run a test on the offset.”

**Tharion**: “Tomorrow. It's past midnight.”

**Liora**: “Five more minutes?”

A tiny, real smile pulls at the corner of his mouth.

**Tharion**: “Five more minutes.”

They keep working, shoulders inches apart, lamplight swaying above them like a blessing.

# **2. Testing Integration — “What Does It Feel Like?”**

A training chamber deep beneath the Spire.
Rings of chalk, threads of runelight, drifting motes of shade.

Liora threads the rune-sequence carefully.
Tharion maintains the containment field—shadows held taut like strings of a harp.

**Liora**: “Now—hold it steady while I thread the seventh node—”

**Tharion**: “Already there.”

She blinks, startled.
A breathless laugh escapes before she can stop it.

**Liora**: “You’re anticipating me.”

**Tharion**: “You’re predictable.”

Beat.

**Tharion**: “In the best way.”

Her pulse stutters—just once.
Their hands brush as she threads the rune through his shadow-work.

Both freeze.

**Tharion**: *quiet, honest*
“Your runes stabilize my shadows. They shouldn’t. Shadeweave rejects structure. But yours doesn’t feel like constraint.”

**Liora**: *barely above a whisper*
“What does it feel like?”

He looks at her. Really looks.

**Tharion**:
“Partnership.”

And for once, neither of them looks away.

# **3. Reading the Same Book — “I Speak Your Language”**

A single tome spanning half the table.
Soul-fragment anchoring diagrams spread across the pages, pulsing faintly.

They lean close.
Too close.
Both pretending they don’t notice.

**Liora**: “This section on dual-resonance—”

**Tharion**: “—matches what we saw in the Vault. The overlapping frequencies.”

**Liora**: “Exactly. If we apply that to the retrieval framework—”

**Tharion**: “Then the fragment won’t resist integration. We won’t be forcing alignment.
We’ll be offering synchronization.”

Their eyes lift at the same moment.
Inches apart.

Something warm and terrifying flickers between them.

**Liora**: *barely breathing*
“You understand.”

**Tharion**:
“I always understand you.”

She doesn’t know what to do with that.
No one has ever said anything like it to her.

**Liora**: “I usually have to explain—”

**Tharion**: “Not to me. You think in architecture. I think in pressure. But it’s the same language underneath.”

**Liora**: “What language?”

**Tharion**: *softly, like a secret*
“Truth.”

Before either can move—

**Mira** leans in the doorway, arms crossed, smiling like someone who sees ten steps ahead.

**Mira**: “You two found something?”

They leap apart like guilty teenagers.

**Liora**: *flustered*
“Yes—we—well, the framework—”

**Tharion**: *composed but faintly pink*
“We should test it. Tomorrow.”

**Mira**: *knowing smile*
“Tomorrow. Right. Good work, you two.”

She leaves.

Silence returns.

**Liora**: “We should—”

**Tharion**: “Yeah. We should.”

Neither moves.

**Liora**:
“Tharion.”

**Tharion**:
“Liora.”

Liora swallows.
Voice small but brave:

**Liora**: “When this is over… when we bring him back… can we—”

**Tharion**: *immediate, absolute*
“Yes.”

She laughs—quiet, helpless.

**Liora**:
“I didn’t finish the question.”

**Tharion**: *smiles faintly*
“Didn’t need to.
My answer’s the same.”

⭐ THE ALMOST-KISS (Book 4 Preview)

(Scene: Deep Archive, late night, after hours of work on Step 24.)

The Archive is nearly dark — only two lamps burning, pools of warm gold cutting through the chill.
Runes scatter faint glimmers across the tables.
Charts, resonance diagrams, shade-containment sketches everywhere.

Liora and Tharion are alone.

They were supposed to stop an hour ago.

They didn’t.

Scene

Liora leans over a resonance graph, tracing a line with her fingertip.
Her hair falls forward.
Tharion reaches out without thinking — gently brushing it back so it won’t dip into the ink.

He freezes a second too late.

His hand lingers at the side of her face.

Liora goes completely still.

Liora: soft, breath catching
“Tharion…”

He drops his hand — not abruptly, but slowly, deliberately, as if fighting himself.

Tharion:
“Sorry. You had—ah—ink.”

Liora glances at the surface of the parchment.
There is no ink.
Not even close.

A tiny smile tugs at her mouth.

Liora:
“There wasn’t.”

Tharion’s jaw tightens — embarrassment flickering, then something deeper, warmer, more terrified.

A low hum builds around them — a stabilizing field Tharion unconsciously maintains when he’s nervous.
Shadows wrap lightly around his boots, not threatening… protective.

Liora steps closer, the space between them shrinking.

The resonance diagram pulses.

Liora:
“When this is over… when we bring him home… I don’t want to pretend anymore.”

Tharion inhales, sharp but silent.

He’s not good with vulnerability.
Not with feelings.
But with her?
He doesn’t retreat.

Tharion: voice low, certain
“I don’t want to pretend either.”

His hand lifts again — slower this time — tracing the air near her cheek, waiting for any sign she doesn’t want this.

She doesn’t move away.

Their foreheads almost brush.

Liora tilts her face up.

Tharion’s breath catches.

Their lips hover a breath apart — so close the shadeweave stirs around them, not resisting, not shielding, but pulling inward like gravity.

A fragile, aching moment —

The door slams open.

Kaelen bursts in, full-chaos energy as always.

Kaelen:
“Guys! Guys, you need to—oh.”
Sees them. Stops dead.
“Uh. Sorry. Were you… studying?”

Silence.

Liora’s face is crimson.

Tharion straightens, shadows snapping into disciplined order.

Tharion:
“Yes. We were studying.”

Kaelen looks between them, then at the distance (or lack of it) between their bodies, then at the resonance graph, then back at them.

Kaelen:
“…Right. Studying. Got it.”

He backs out of the room slowly.

Kaelen: calling down the hall
“Mira! I think I interrupted something important!
—No, not dangerous!
—Well maybe dangerous!
—Emotional danger!
—Just come here!”

Liora covers her face with both hands.

Tharion exhales, long and heavy, leaning back against the table.

Tharion:
“…We should go back to work.”

Liora: without lowering her hands
“Yes. Work.”

Beat.

Tharion:
“But the question still stands.”

Liora peeks at him through her fingers.

Liora:
“Which question?”

He meets her gaze — steady now, controlled, but full of things he’s never said aloud.

Tharion:
“When this is over…
when he’s home…
what we almost did —
should that be a ‘not yet’… or a ‘not until’?”

Liora lowers her hands.

Steps close again.

Liora: quiet but firm
“Not until.
Not instead.”

Tharion nods — accepting the boundary, but the warmth in his eyes confirms he heard the yes beneath it.

Kaelen from the hallway:
“Liora, Tharion! Mira says if you two don’t open this door she’s coming in with snacks and questions!”

Liora groans.

Tharion actually smiles.
