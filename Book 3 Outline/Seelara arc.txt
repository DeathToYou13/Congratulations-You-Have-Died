PRE-DISSOLUTION (Book 3 - Building Tension):
Early Book 3: "The Watcher"
Scene: Training yard
Lucien practicing control of soul-body misalignment. Getting frustrated. Power flickering.
Selara's on the perimeter (security rotation). Professional positioning.
But her eyes track: Every flicker. Every stumble. Every moment he winces from the disconnection pain.
Gavren (beside her): "He's improving."
Selara: "His reserves deplete faster than they restore. The 23% fragment can't sustain—" [catches herself] "Tharion's analysis indicated as much."
Gavren: [Says nothing, but exchanges glance with Veyric]

Mid Book 3: "Research Session"
Scene: Library - Lucien researching the Truths
Multiple people helping. Liora coordinating. Tharion consulting historical texts.
Selara brings requested archive documents (retainer duty).
Sets them on table. Professional. Efficient.
Then sees what Lucien's reading: "Truth 19 - The Dissolution of Self"
Her hand hesitates. Quarter-second. On the document.
Then she's already walking away.
Lucien doesn't notice. Too absorbed in reading.
Mira notices. The wisp notices. Something in Selara's rhythm changed. Just for a heartbeat.

Late Book 3: "The Night Before"
Scene: Evening before Lucien begins the final Truths
Pack gathering. Trying to be normal. Tension underneath everything.
Selara's on perimeter (always is). Professional distance.
Lucien laughs at something Kaelen says. Real laugh. Probably last one for a while.
Selara's breath catches. Silent. She turns away, pretends to check something on her belt.
Sienna sees it. Across the room. Recognizes the body language of someone trying not to break.
Files it away. Doesn't approach yet. But... she saw.

THE THARION SCENE (Already written)
Lucien walks toward the 23rd Truth. Selara watches him leave. Tharion confronts her.

"You love him."
"That is why I will not break him."


POST-DISSOLUTION (Book 3 - The Grief):
Immediate Aftermath: "The Standing"
Scene: Lucien dissolves into light
Everyone reacting. Pack devastated. Theron and Sera holding each other.
Selara stands. Perfectly still. Professional posture maintained.
But her hands—clasped behind her back—are trembling.
No one's looking at her. Everyone focused on where Lucien was. On the light. On their own grief.
Except Mira.
Mira's wisp drifts toward Selara. Curious. Confused. Sensing... something.
Mira (through the bond, to Kaelen): "Something's wrong with—" [looks at Selara]
Kaelen: "What?"
Mira: [Shakes head] "Nothing. Later."

Week 1: "The Recognition"
Scene: Mira finds Selara on battlements
Not deliberately seeking her. Just happened to be there. Late evening. Selara staring at the sky where he dissolved.
Mira: [Quiet approach] "I didn't think anyone else came here."
Selara: [Doesn't turn] "I was just leaving."
But she doesn't move.
Long silence.
Mira: "My wisp keeps searching for him. In the currents. She doesn't understand why he's... everywhere and nowhere."
Selara: [Very quiet] "I understand."
Mira: [Turns to look at her] "Do you?"
Selara: [Still not looking at her] "I should return to duties."
Mira: "Selara."
Selara: [Finally turns. Eyes dry but something broken underneath] "He had to do this. I know he did. It doesn't—" [stops herself]
Mira: [Soft] "Doesn't make it easier."
Selara: [Throat works. Can't speak. Just shakes her head once]
Mira: "I'm here. If you need... I'm here."
Selara nods. Once. Can't trust her voice.
Mira doesn't push. Just stands beside her. Two people staring at the sky.
Sharing silence. Sharing grief.

Week 3: "The Humor Attempt"
Scene: Selara in armory, maintaining equipment
Methodical. Focused. Too focused.
Sienna: [Enters with her own gear] "Hey. Mind if I—"
Selara: "Of course not."
They work in silence. Sienna cleaning fire-scorched bracers. Selara sharpening blades.
Sienna: [After a while] "You know what Kaelen said yesterday? He said Lucien's probably up there judging our form. 'Zero out of ten, needs more cosmic awareness.'"
Silence.
Sienna: [Glances over] "It was funnier when he said it."
Selara: "I'm sure it was." [Keeps working]
Sienna: [Sets down her work] "I'm not good at this. The serious stuff. I make jokes when things hurt because... I don't know. It's what I do."
Selara: "You don't need to—"
Sienna: "But I see you. In the hallways. During meals. Standing watch. And you're... you're doing the same thing I do. Just quieter."
Selara: [Hands still. Doesn't look up] "I don't know what you mean."
Sienna: "Yeah. You do."
Silence.
Sienna: "We're building the retrieval framework. Liora's got theories. Mira's mapping the currents. We're going to bring him back."
Selara: [Very quiet] "What if he doesn't want to come back?"
Sienna: [Surprised by the question] "He will."
Selara: "He's EVERYTHING now. Why would he choose to be small again?"
Sienna: [Moves closer] "Because we're here. Because he's ours. Because..." [softer] "Because you're here."
Selara: [Finally looks up. Eyes sharp, defensive] "He doesn't—"
Sienna: "I saw you. The night before. Watching him."
Selara: [Looks away] "I was on duty."
Sienna: "Yeah." [Beat] "Me too. For Brenn. Every second. In case..." [shakes her head] "We're all on duty for someone."
They don't speak after that. Just work.
But when Selara leaves, Sienna calls after her: "He's coming back. Hold on to that."
Selara doesn't respond. But her hands stop shaking.

Month 2: "The Calculation"
Scene: Liora presenting retrieval research
Big gathering. Explaining how the 23% fragment could serve as anchor. Technical. Detailed.
Selara's there (Tharion's there, she accompanies).
Liora: "The fragment exists outside the Sixth Current because it predates his transformation. If we can—"
Selara: [Quiet interruption] "What's the success probability?"
Everyone looks at her. She doesn't usually speak in these meetings.
Liora: "It's difficult to—"
Selara: "Percentage. Estimation."
Liora: [Hesitates] "Forty percent. Maybe less."
Silence.
Selara: "And if we fail?"
Liora: "The fragment dissolves. He remains the Sixth Current. Permanently."
Selara: "Then we can't fail." [Not emotional. Statement of fact.]
Liora: [Studies her] "We won't. I promise."
Selara: [Meets her eyes] "Don't promise what you can't control."
Liora: "Then I promise I won't stop working until the probability is higher."
Selara: [Long moment] "Thank you."
Liora: [Soft] "You're welcome."
After the meeting, Liora approaches Tharion: "She's... invested in this."
Tharion: [Quiet] "She has her reasons."
Liora: "Do I want to know?"
Tharion: "She'd prefer you didn't ask."
Liora: "But you know."
Tharion: "I know."

Month 6: "The Almost-Break"
Scene: Night. Selara training alone
Pushing too hard. Shadeweave techniques. Again and again. Faster. Harder.
Veyric: [Watching from doorway] "Sel. It's past midnight."
Selara: [Doesn't stop] "I'm fine."
Veyric: "You're exhausted."
Selara: [Keeps going. Technique sloppy now. She NEVER gets sloppy] "I said I'm fine."
Veyric: "Selara—"
Selara: [Technique fails. Shadeweave collapses. She SLAMS her hand against the wall] "FUCK."
Silence. She's breathing hard. Hand bleeding.
Veyric: [Quiet] "When's the last time you slept?"
Selara: [Back against wall. Slides down. Sitting.] "I don't know."
Veyric: [Sits beside her. Says nothing]
Long silence.
Selara: [Quiet, broken] "What if we can't bring him back?"
Veyric: "Liora says—"
Selara: "Liora's guessing. We're all guessing. What if the fragment doesn't remember being him? What if it doesn't WANT to be him? What if—" [voice cracks]
Veyric: "Selara."
Selara: [Can't speak. Just shaking her head]
Veyric: [After long pause] "You love him."
Selara: [Whisper] "It doesn't matter."
Veyric: "It's the only thing that does."
She doesn't cry. Doesn't break. Just sits there with her bleeding hand and her exhaustion and her grief.
Veyric: "Come on. Medical wing. Sleep. Training when you're functional."
She lets him help her up. Because she can't do this alone anymore.

Month 11: "The Vigil"
Scene: Retrieval attempt beginning
Everyone at their positions. Mira navigating. Liora structuring. Tharion containing.
Selara's not part of the team. She's... just there. On the perimeter. Where she always is.
Mira: [Before entering the Sixth Current] "Selara."
Selara: [Looks up]
Mira: "I'll bring him back."
Selara: [Can't speak. Just nods]
Mira: "I know what he means to you."
Selara: [Whisper] "Bring him home."
Mira: "I will."
Then the retrieval begins. And Selara stands vigil.
Watching. Waiting. Unable to help.
Just like she did when he walked toward the 23rd Truth.

The Pattern:
Pre-dissolution: Tension building. Micro-tells. Watching. Can't look away.
Post-dissolution:

Mira: Recognizes grief through spirit-sense. Offers shared silence.
Sienna: Tries humor, then honesty. "We're all on duty for someone."
Liora: Provides hope through work. Promises to keep trying.
Veyric: Witnesses the almost-break. Holds space for it.

Selara never asks for help. But they give it anyway. Because they see her. And they understand.
This is Pack extending to include her. Not because she asked. Because she needs it.
And when Lucien returns fractured in Book 4, they'll ALL know why she's the one who can help him rebuild.
Because they watched her survive his absence.
Quiet. Patient. Devastating.
