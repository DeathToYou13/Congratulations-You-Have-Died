### **THE SCENE (short sketch):**

Lucien walks toward the 23rd Truth — exhausted, shimmering, half-unraveling.

Selara watches him leave — steady posture, controlled breath, eyes like a calm lake with a storm underneath.

Tharion stands beside her, arms folded.

A long moment passes.

Then, quietly:

**Tharion:**
“Selara.”

She doesn’t look at him.
Eyes fixed on Lucien.

**Selara:**
“He has to do this.”

**Tharion:**
“That’s not what I asked.”

She exhales, jaw tightening.

**Selara:**
“Then don’t ask.”

Tharion studies her profile — the stiffness in her shoulders, the slight tremor in her breath, the way her hand curls as if reaching for someone she refuses to reach for.

His voice is softer than she expects.

**Tharion:**
“You care for him.”

She freezes.

Not dramatically —
just one tiny stillness, like a dropped heartbeat.

**Selara:**
“No.”

**Tharion:**
“You do.”
(A beat.)
“Subtly. Quietly. Badly.”

Her eyes finally flick toward him—sharp, wounded, defensive.

**Selara:**
“He is important to the Spire.”

**Tharion:**
“He is important to *you*.”

Silence.

Lucien is now nearly out of sight.

Tharion steps closer—not threatening, not smug.

Just honest.

Painfully, compassionately honest.

**Tharion:**
“If you’re going to stop him… it has to be now.”

Her throat works.

Her voice is barely a whisper:

**Selara:**
“If I stop him… he never becomes what he must.”

**Tharion:**
“And if you don’t, you may lose him.”

Selara’s hands tremble once.
She clasps them behind her back to hide it.

Her eyes never leave Lucien.

**Selara:**
“Then I will lose him.”

Tharion’s expression softens—respect, surprise, grief.

He bows his head slightly.

**Tharion:**
“You love him.”

Her whisper breaks:

**Selara:**
“That is why I will not break him.”

Lucien disappears into the light.

Selara stands alone.

And the path takes him.
