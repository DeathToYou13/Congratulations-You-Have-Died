Book 2, Chapter 5 – Light Shared

The summons arrived at breakfast—formal parchment sealed with Aurelián's crest and countersigned by the Crown:
By decree of His Majesty King Aldric Alaris, Crown Princess Elara Alaris shall undertake study at Aurelián Spire under the tutelage of Highmaster Valthorne, effective immediately. This education is deemed essential to the security and prosperity of the realm.
Below it, in Valthorne's careful script: Lucien—feel free to bring your packmates. - V
"They're bringing her here," Mira said, reading over Lucien's shoulder.
"Who?" Kaelen asked through a mouthful of bread.
"Princess Elara." Lucien set the parchment down carefully. "The one whose Radiance erupted during her presentation to court three days ago."
Through the bond, he felt the Pack's immediate wariness. Politics. Royalty. Danger.
"Valthorne wants us in his study," Liora said, pointing to the note. "All of us."
They heard the formal arrival from the corridors—boot-steps in perfect formation, the rustle of ceremonial cloaks, announcements echoing through the entrance hall.
"Crown Princess Elara Alaris, accompanied by Captain Seren Valenne of the Royal Guard."
By the time they reached Valthorne's study, the official party was already being shown in. Two royal guardsmen flanked the door. Inside, Captain Seren Valenne stood at parade rest—not just a Fireweave master, but Captain of the Royal Guard. Every line of her scarred frame radiated lethal competence and absolute discipline. Her hand rested near her sword hilt, but her eyes tracked Elara with something warmer than duty. Affection, carefully controlled.
And beside her, Crown Princess Elara.
Fifteen years old—officially an adult as of three days ago. Dark hair bound in a practical braid rather than elaborate court style, traveling cloak over well-made but understated clothing. She carried herself with the posture of someone trained from birth to represent a kingdom—spine straight, chin level, hands relaxed at her sides. But there was something in her eyes when she looked at Valthorne. Not desperation. Relief.
"Uncle Val," she said, and her voice was steady, warm, controlled. "Thank you for receiving us on such short notice."
Valthorne's ancient face softened. "Little star. You're always welcome here." He gestured to chairs. "Please, sit. Captain Valenne, you as well."
Seren remained standing. "With respect, Highmaster, I prefer to—"
"Seren," Elara said gently. "It's safe here. Sit."
The captain hesitated, then lowered herself into a chair, hand still resting near her sword. Her eyes continued their careful scan of the room—assessing, protecting, but also observing. Like someone gathering information for more than just immediate security.
"I'll have tea brought," Valthorne said, moving toward the door. "Elara, there's someone I'd like you to meet. He should arrive shortly."
He opened the door to find Lucien and his Pack already waiting in the corridor.
"Impeccable timing," Valthorne said with the faintest smile. "All of you, come in."
Seven students filed in—various states of morning dishevelment, uncertainty clear on their faces. Lucien stepped forward first, meeting Valthorne's eyes in silent question.
"Princess Elara," Valthorne said, "may I introduce Lucien Alaris. Your distant cousin, and—as of five years ago—a fellow Radiant."
Elara stood, grace incarnate even in her surprise. Her eyes found Lucien's—really looked at him. Saw a boy younger than her, wearing exhaustion like a cloak, surrounded by friends who moved like guards.
"Lord Alaris," she said, inclining her head. Perfect courtesy. "I... wasn't aware there was another awakening."
"It wasn't public knowledge," Lucien said carefully. "My parents kept it quiet. For safety."
"I understand that impulse better now than I did three days ago." Elara's composure didn't crack, but something in her voice shifted. "You were seven when it happened?"
"Yes, Your Highness."
"Elara," she corrected. "Please. We're cousins, and apparently we share something rather significant." She glanced at Valthorne. "Is that why Father sent me here? Because there was another Alaris who could help me understand?"
"Your father sent you here because Aurelián is the finest institution in the known world for magical education," Valthorne said carefully. "That we have another young Alaris Radiant is... fortunate. Comparing your manifestations might help us understand what's happening with the bloodline."
Elara absorbed this with visible calculation. Then, to Lucien: "You've been managing this power for five years. That must have been... challenging."
"It has been," Lucien said. Through the bond, he felt Mira's gentle encouragement. "But I've had help." He gestured to his Pack. "They've kept me functional."
"I have Captain Valenne," Elara said, and there was genuine gratitude there. "She contained my manifestation during the presentation. Kept me from hurting anyone." A pause. "But she's a Fireweave master, not Radiant. I think... I think I need someone who understands what this feels like."
"It feels like drowning in light," Lucien said quietly.
Elara's perfect composure slipped—just for a heartbeat. "Yes. Exactly that."
Valthorne cleared his throat gently. "Which is why I've proposed a comparative study. Understanding your individual manifestations, what makes them similar or different—it might help ensure you both develop safely."
"A study," Elara repeated. She looked at Lucien. "Would you be willing? I realize you've probably been examined quite enough already."
The memory of the Conclave's testing—Cassius's fanatic curiosity, the black towers, nearly being torn apart—flickered through Lucien's mind. But Valthorne was asking. And this girl, this princess, was asking with genuine respect for his choice.
"I'm willing," he said. "If it helps."
"Thank you." Elara's shoulders dropped slightly—tension releasing. "I know this is strange. I'm—" She glanced at Valthorne, then back to Lucien. "I'm trying to handle this the way a Crown Princess should. With dignity. But truthfully, I'm glad I'm not the only one anymore."
The quiet admission carried more weight than any dramatic confession could have.
After the formal introductions, after tea and careful diplomatic conversation, after the guardsmen had been dismissed to wait in the entrance hall, Elara remained in Valthorne's study. Seren stayed as well, positioned near the door—protective but not intrusive.
The door closed. The mask dropped—not completely, but enough.
"Uncle Val," Elara said, and her voice was still controlled but softer now. "I need help. Father sent me here because the court doesn't know what to do with me, and he can't risk showing that uncertainty. He thinks if I train quietly at Aurelián, we can present it as planned education rather than—" She paused. "—rather than a crisis."
Valthorne moved to stand beside her. "Is that what it feels like? A crisis?"
"I don't know what it feels like," Elara admitted. "The power is there, burning under my skin. I can feel it all the time now. Captain Valenne has been teaching me to channel instead of contain, but she doesn't understand Radiance. She can't." Her hands, which had been perfectly still, moved to grip the arms of her chair. "You do. Lucien does. I'm not falling apart, Uncle Val. But I'm out of my depth, and I need someone I can trust to help me understand before I drown in this."
It wasn't desperation. It was the controlled admission of someone who rarely got to show vulnerability, making a choice to trust someone who'd earned it.
Valthorne's hand found her shoulder. "You won't drown, little star. We're going to figure this out. Together."
"Promise?"
"I promise."
Elara took a slow breath, rebuilt her composure piece by piece. When she looked up again, the Crown Princess had returned—but something warmer remained underneath.
"The comparative study," she said. "When do we begin?"
The Resonance Chamber had been prepared with care—cushioned chairs at each testing station, warm light instead of harsh diagnostic glare, the Pack and Seren positioned nearby as support rather than behind containment barriers. Valthorne had learned from previous disasters.
Liora moved between instrument arrays, setting up measurement protocols. Tharion arrived with Selara—his most senior retainer, moving with the careful awareness of someone always cataloging threats and escape routes. Her dark eyes swept the room before settling—briefly—on Lucien.
"Your Highness," Tharion said, bowing formally. "Lord Alaris." The second bow was shallower but respectful.
"Lord Draemir," Elara acknowledged. "I understand you've been researching historical records. Father mentioned your findings."
"Findings that suggest divine interference in magical development," Tharion said carefully. "Truth that many would prefer remained buried."
"Truth is rarely convenient," Elara said. "That doesn't make it less necessary."
Something in Tharion's expression shifted—recognition, perhaps, or respect. "No, Your Highness. It doesn't."
Valthorne gestured toward the testing stations. "If you're both ready—Princess Elara, the western node. Lucien, the eastern."
They moved into position. Elara's hands were steady as she placed them on the sigils, but Lucien saw her take a deliberate breath first. Centering herself.
Across from her, he pressed his palms to the runes and tried not to think about the last time he'd been in this chamber.
Through the bond: We're here. Right here.
Liora activated the first array. "Beginning with Princess Elara—baseline resonance scan."
The crystals hummed. Light blossomed around Elara—gold and warm, flickering slightly like candle flame finding its rhythm. She held perfectly still, maintaining control through visible effort. Numbers appeared in the air above her:
ELARA ALARIS
Age: 15
Awakening: 72 hours prior
Current Capacity: 8.7%
Resonance Tier: Standard noble-tier Radiant
Stability: UNSTABLE (expected for new manifestation)
Notes: Rapid surface manifestation, deep reserves undeveloped
"Eight point seven percent," Liora murmured, making notes. "That's quite good for three days, Your Highness. You're developing quickly."
"Captain Valenne's training," Elara said, voice steady despite the light pooling around her fingers. "She's been teaching me to channel rather than contain."
"It shows," Valthorne said approvingly. "Your control is remarkable for someone so newly awakened."
The light around Elara steadied, evened out. She met his eyes briefly—gratitude without breaking focus.
"Now Lucien," Valthorne said quietly.
Lucien pressed deeper into the sigils. The chamber's hum changed pitch, resonance building like a held breath. His anchor—the golden mark at his collarbone—began to glow.
The array flared. Numbers cascaded:
LUCIEN ALARIS
Age: 12
Awakening: 5 years prior
Previous Reading (21 days ago): 23.000% capacity
Current Capacity: 100.0% [MAXIMUM]
Resonance Tier: [ERROR - EXCEEDS CLASSIFICATION SCALE]
Stability: MINOR FLUCTUATION (manageable)
Structural Integrity: Slight soul-body misalignment detected
Notes: Unprecedented capacity magnitude. Harmonic irregularity detected.
"One hundred percent," Liora breathed, staring at the display. "And the magnitude—"
She pulled up a comparison chart, placing Elara's and Lucien's readings side by side. Elara's capacity showed as a modest bar—8.7% of her potential, clearly visible scale. Lucien's capacity filled the entire display and kept trying to go higher, numbers flickering at the edge of what the array could measure.
"That's not just advanced development," Tharion said, moving closer. "That's a completely different order of magnitude. I've never seen a reading that high."
"Neither have I," Valthorne said quietly, and there was wonder in his voice. "In two centuries of teaching, I've seen powerful students. Prodigies. But this..." He studied the display, then Lucien. "This is something I've only read about in the oldest texts. Legendary capacity—so rare the records barely acknowledge it exists."
"Legendary?" Elara said, looking between the displays.
"Beyond even exceptional talent," Valthorne explained. "Most awakened individuals develop to perhaps seventy, eighty percent of theoretical maximum capacity in their lifetime. Very gifted individuals might reach ninety percent. The accepted limit for natural development is ninety-six percent—that's considered full mastery, the practical ceiling of mortal magic." He gestured at Lucien's readings. "Lucien is at one hundred percent. Beyond what should be achievable. And the magnitude suggests his baseline power output exceeds what most master-level casters achieve at their peak."
Liora was frantically checking measurements. "The array's having trouble quantifying it. The resonance strength is off our standard scales." She paused, frowning at a secondary readout. "Highmaster, there's also a structural notation. Slight soul-body misalignment."
Valthorne moved closer to examine the data. "Misalignment... yes, I see it. Minor, but present. The soul's resonance and the body's natural frequency aren't quite synchronized." He looked at Lucien with concern. "Have you noticed any symptoms? Disorientation, feeling disconnected from your physical form?"
"Sometimes," Lucien admitted. "Mostly when I'm tired. Like my body and mind are slightly out of step."
"That would match the readings," Valthorne said carefully. "The misalignment is manageable now, but it could worsen as your capacity continues developing. We'll need to monitor it closely." He didn't say what they were all thinking—that soul-body misalignment could lead to catastrophic instability if left unchecked.
"Why would there be misalignment?" Elara asked. "Is that common with early awakenings?"
"No," Valthorne said. "Early awakening doesn't typically cause structural issues. This is..." He studied the readings again. "Unusual. As if the soul and body weren't meant to be paired, or something interfered with their natural integration."
Through the bond, Lucien felt the Pack's tension. They knew what caused it—violent theft across worlds, a soul ripped from one reality and forced into another. But no one here could know that.
"Could it be related to the legendary capacity?" Liora suggested. "Power of that magnitude trying to express through a mortal vessel?"
"Possibly," Valthorne allowed. "Though I'd expect different symptoms. This looks more like... incompatibility, rather than strain."
"Regardless of cause," Seren said from her position near the door, "it's something that needs careful management. Your Highness, this is another reason close supervision at Aurelián is essential."
Elara nodded, still studying the displays with focused intelligence. She turned to look at Lucien. "You went from twenty-three percent to one hundred percent in three weeks?"
"Yes," Lucien said simply.
"How?"
Lucien met her eyes. Felt the weight of everything he couldn't say—I gave consent to a god and unlocked a System that was never meant to exist—and found the only truth he could offer.
"Something changed. I don't fully understand what. But power that was... dormant... isn't anymore."
"And the legendary capacity?" Elara pressed gently. "Is that new too, or were you always—"
"I don't know," Lucien admitted. "The Conclave's testing three weeks ago showed the twenty-three percent. Everything else was..." He paused. "Hidden, maybe. Or just not measurable until recently."
Tharion had been studying a secondary display showing capacity distribution patterns. "There's something else. The previous reading from the Conclave showed seventy-seven percent capacity as absent—not developing, not suppressed. Gone. Now it's..." He gestured at the display. "Integrated. Present. Or..." He frowned. "Attempting to integrate."
"What do you mean 'attempting'?" Mira asked.
"The fluctuations in the resonance pattern," Tharion said, pointing to minor irregularities in the waveform. "They're consistent with incomplete integration. As if the full capacity is there but not entirely... connected. Working together but not quite unified."
Liora pulled up detailed structural analysis. "He's right. The twenty-three percent shows perfect stability—clean resonance, no irregularities. But the rest..." She traced the patterns with her finger. "There's a slight disconnect. Like two pieces that should fit seamlessly but have a hairline gap between them."
"Could that explain the soul-body misalignment?" Elara asked.
"It might contribute," Valthorne said. "If the capacity itself isn't fully unified, that could create additional strain on the soul-body connection." He looked at Lucien. "Has anything changed recently? Anything that might have triggered the seventy-seven percent to... appear?"
"During my trials," Lucien said carefully. "When I lost control. Something... shifted. Like a lock opening."
"A seal breaking," Valthorne murmured. "Or being broken." He exchanged glances with Tharion. "Which brings us to my colleague's research findings."
Tharion’s pulse quickened—the phrasing matched what he’d seen carved beneath the Annex vault: Directive A-0 – Safeguard Implemented.
Tharion pulled out his notes from the Archive expedition, spreading several pages of careful documentation across the console.
Tharion pulled out his notes from the Archive expedition, spreading several pages of careful documentation across the console.
"The records I found suggest—and I emphasize suggest, as the documentation was heavily redacted—that there may be divine regulations on spiritual capacity development."
"May be?" Elara said.
"The texts were deliberately obscured," Tharion explained. "But the pattern is consistent across multiple sources. References to compliance protocols, capacity optimization, Current maintenance requirements. Individually they could be bureaucratic notation. Together..."
He pulled out a reconstructed document fragment, projecting it above the console.
Divine Compliance Protocol: Amendment C-12
Spiritual Capacity Ceiling — Universal Application
All awakened individuals shall manifest to maximum sustainable threshold of 96% assessed capacity.
This ceiling represents optimal balance between mortal development and systemic stability.
Excess potential beyond 96% threshold shall be redirected to Current maintenance and divine infrastructure support.
Natural development ceiling: 100% (theoretical maximum)
Imposed regulatory ceiling: 96% (enforced standard)
Overflow redirection: 4% minimum per individual
Aggregate collection: [CALCULATION REDACTED]
Authorized by: The Divine Accord
Enforced through: The Five Currents
Exceptions: [SECTION REDACTED]
Implementation Date: [PARTIALLY ILLEGIBLE] …at least 847 years prior
Justification: Prevention of destabilization events. Maintenance of Current infrastructure. Orderly magical development within acceptable parameters.
The room went very quiet.
"Ninety-six percent," Liora breathed. "They capped everyone at ninety-six percent. Four percent below natural maximum."
"And called it 'optimal balance,'" Tharion said, shadows coiling tighter. "When really they're harvesting that four percent—and likely more from those who would naturally develop beyond one hundred percent—to fuel their own systems."
"For at least eight hundred forty-seven years," Valthorne added, reading the dates. "Possibly longer if the earlier records are incomplete."
Elara's hand moved to her chest, where her anchor mark was forming. "You're saying that when I reach full development—if I reach what everyone thinks is mastery at ninety-six percent—I'm actually being stopped four percent short of my natural limit?"
"If my interpretation is correct, yes," Tharion said carefully. "And that four percent would be redirected to divine infrastructure. But Your Highness—I want to be clear. This is interpretation of fragmentary documents. I don't have definitive proof the system is currently active. Only that it was designed and implemented centuries ago."
"But you believe it's still active," Seren said. It wasn't a question.
"The pattern matches too well with what we're seeing," Tharion admitted. "The Conclave's testing protocols, the accepted wisdom about capacity limits, the way awakened individuals consistently plateau at ninety-six percent..." He gestured at Lucien's readings. "And then there's Lord Alaris. At one hundred percent. Four percent beyond the imposed ceiling."
"Which makes you proof," Elara said to Lucien, "that the ceiling isn't natural law. You've exceeded it."
"Apparently," Lucien said quietly.
Valthorne studied the projection, then Lucien's readings. "If Tharion's theory is correct—and the evidence is compelling—then the regulation was either never properly applied to Lucien, or something broke it during his trials. Either way, he represents what unrestricted development looks like. And it's..." He paused, searching for words. "Extraordinary. Frightening. And proof that mortals are capable of far more than the Divine Accord wants us to believe."
"Your Highness," Seren said carefully, "this information—if accurate—is a matter of kingdom security. His Majesty should be informed."
"He should," Elara agreed. Her voice carried the weight of careful political calculation. "But we need more than fragmentary documents and theory first." She turned to address both Tharion and Valthorne. "Can you both continue investigating? Lord Draemir, you have access to the Archives. Uncle Val, you have centuries of institutional knowledge here. Between you, can you find more evidence? Determine if these regulations are real and how they're currently enforced?"
Tharion inclined his head. "I can continue searching. Though as I said, the records are deliberately obscured. It will take time."
"I can research from the Spire's collections," Valthorne added. "Cross-reference what Tharion finds with our oldest texts. But the Conclave has kept these secrets well-hidden. Unraveling them won't be quick."
"We have time," Elara said. "Father authorized open-ended study. I'm not leaving until we understand what we're dealing with." She looked at Lucien. "For both our sakes."
Through the bond: She's being methodical. Smart. Building allies.
"Thank you," Lucien said. "For wanting to understand rather than just... react."
"We're family," Elara said simply. "And we're both dealing with power that makes people nervous. That makes us allies, whether we planned it or not."
The grace in that—accepting alliance without demanding secrets—settled something in Lucien's chest.
After the diagnostic ended, Valthorne arranged for Elara's quarters. As everyone prepared to leave, Seren drew Valthorne aside for a quiet word.
"The King is aware that Lord Alaris manifested at seven and had an incident during his trials," Seren said, voice low. "The Conclave reported it. His Majesty is concerned about patterns. About what might be hidden."
"Your presence here isn't just protective duty," Valthorne said.
"I serve Princess Elara first," Seren said firmly. "But His Majesty trusts my judgment. If there are truths being suppressed by other powers—truths that affect the realm—I have discretion to relay them through proper channels."
"The Conclave has kept secrets too long," Valthorne agreed. "But the Princess is just finding her footing. Let trust build naturally."
"I won't push." Seren glanced toward where Elara spoke with Lucien and the Pack. "She's stronger than people realize. She'll find truth on her own timeline."
After Elara and Seren departed, Valthorne closed the door and turned to face the Pack.
"Say it," Lucien said quietly.
Valthorne’s gaze traveled across the group, resting finally on the diagnostic sigils flickering above the table. "Legendary capacity," he murmured. "Seventy-seven percent absent, suddenly present. Soul-body misalignment. Incomplete integration." He turned back. "You all know why this is happening."
No one answered at first. The hum of the instruments filled the silence—measured, patient, expectant.
Then Liora stepped forward. "Before we do this," she said, her voice steady, "we need to decide something first."
Mira glanced at her. "Liora?"
She looked toward Tharion. "If we’re going to talk about what really happened, he deserves to be here. He’s already risked more for us than most who claim loyalty."
Kaelen’s brow furrowed. "You’re sure?"
"Yes." Liora didn’t hesitate. "Trust isn’t earned by silence—it’s proven by sharing what could destroy us."
Lucien met her eyes through the bond—surprise, then quiet agreement. Mira’s wisp brightened once, as if echoing it. Even Ralen gave a slow nod, arms crossed, his expression unreadable but his stance no longer defensive.
Sienna’s flame dimmed slightly, a mark of controlled tension, then flared once—a wordless affirmation. Brenn reached out to steady her shoulder, grounding her the way only he could.
The Highmaster’s silence pressed like gravity. Through the bond, Lucien felt his friends hold their breath—a collective instinct that the truth, once spoken, would not be taken back.
Valthorne studied the exchange. "You’re certain of him?"
Lucien nodded. "We are."
Tharion stood a little straighter, the weight of the moment catching him off-guard. "You’re trusting me before you have to," he said quietly.
Liora offered a faint, knowing smile. "That’s what makes it trust."
For a heartbeat, the air seemed lighter—then Valthorne exhaled and gestured to the sigils again. "Then speak the truth you came to."
Mira broke the silence first. "It happened the night before the Elder Peaks journey. In the Archive. That’s when Lucien found the record."
Valthorne’s expression sharpened. "Record?"
Lucien’s voice was low but clear. "It wasn’t regulation that sealed my power. It was something older—a divine safeguard. I found a tome that explained what Aeloran did. My soul was stolen—from another world."
The room held its breath.
Tharion’s eyes flicked to him, then back to Valthorne. "Stolen?"
Lucien nodded. "Taken from my original life—Earth—and forced into this body. The Accord created a lock after that theft, a safeguard to stop gods from ever doing it again. A divine injunction that bound my stolen soul inside this vessel so no one could repeat the crime."
Mira continued softly, "That’s why only twenty-three percent was ever accessible. The rest was sealed to protect the law, not to protect him."
"The night before Elder Peaks," Lucien said, "I understood. I chose to accept it. I gave my own consent—to acknowledge what was taken and make it mine. The lock couldn’t hold once I chose."
Valthorne’s eyes widened, his voice almost a whisper. "You broke a divine safeguard by claiming ownership of your theft."
"Not broke," Lucien said. "Reclaimed."
He drew a breath. "When I accepted it, the seventy-seven percent opened. All at once. The System shut down right after—it was never a control, it was containment. Once I accepted the truth, its purpose ended."
"The theft itself left the wound," Mira added. "That’s why the integration isn’t complete. The lock was gone, but the damage remains."
Sienna’s flame dimmed again, reflecting the tension that filled the room. Brenn’s hand stayed firm on her shoulder, the subtle motion grounding them both. Across from them, Ralen’s jaw clenched—rage barely contained, not at Lucien, but at the gods themselves.
Valthorne turned toward the glowing sigils, the light catching the fine cracks of age around his eyes. "A foreign soul, bound by divine guilt, freed by the act of acceptance." He sounded almost reverent. "The Accord will feel that fracture. They built the safeguard so the heavens could sleep."
"Then they should wake," Tharion said.
Valthorne’s fingers tightened around his staff—not in anger, but restraint. Wonder was a dangerous thing when it brushed against heresy. He looked at Tharion for a long moment—measuring—then something like respect flickered through. "You understand the weight of what you’re saying?"
Tharion nodded. "I do now. You trusted me with the truth. I won’t forget that."
Valthorne’s gaze softened. "Nor will I." He turned back to the others. "What you’ve done tonight changes everything. The right to choose what is yours—even after it was stolen—may be the first act of true defiance the gods have ever seen."
Mira’s voice lowered. "Can Elara know?"
"Not yet," Valthorne said firmly. "She’s three days into her awakening. Stronger than expected, but not ready for this weight. Tell her what she needs—that Lucien’s capacity is unique, his readings irregular. Nothing more."
"So we give her partial truth," Tharion said.
"We give her safe truth," Valthorne corrected. "Let trust build the rest."
Lucien exhaled. "And if she asks directly?"
"Then you decide," Valthorne said. "This story is yours now. What was taken, what was returned—no one else can speak it for you."
Through the bond, warmth spread—solidarity, protection, belief. Mira’s calm, Liora’s quiet conviction, Ralen’s steady presence, Sienna’s flickering resolve, Brenn’s unyielding loyalty—all of it gathered around him like a shield of living will.
"Thank you," Lucien said quietly.
Valthorne shook his head. "Don’t thank me. Just survive long enough to decide what you’ll do with the freedom you bought."
He looked once more at the fading sigils, and for an instant, their dying light reflected like stars in his eyes.
"Because when the Accord realizes their safeguard failed, they’ll come looking for the mortal who proved divine law can break."
