Lullaby of the Radiant Guard

Eight months after the miracle
The summer night clung to the nursery like warm honey—thick, sweet, unmoving. Even with the windows open, the air barely stirred the gauze curtains. The mana-lamps glowed at their lowest setting, bathing everything in soft amber that made each shadow gentle.
Sera paced slowly, her son fussing against her shoulder. Eight months old and deep in the misery of teething—his gums swollen, cheeks flushed, tiny fists batting weakly at her collarbone.
“I know, sweetheart,” she whispered, rocking him. “I know it hurts.”
A small, miserable sound answered. Not quite a cry, but near enough.
Behind her, the old rocking chair creaked. Theron sat slumped in it, rubbing the fatigue from one eye. He’d been awake for nearly an hour now—long after giving up on the hope of sleep.
“Should I call the healer again?” he asked softly.
“She’s already been twice today.” Sera brushed a kiss to Lucien’s warm forehead. “It’ll pass. The tooth just needs time.”
“I can take him for a bit.”
“You let me sleep this afternoon.” She offered him a weary, grateful smile. “It’s all right. I’ve got him.”
Theron rose anyway. His hair was mussed, his steps slow, but his hand steadied gently over Lucien’s back.
“We can try together,” he murmured.
Lucien shifted, not soothed—but not fighting as hard, either.
Sera adjusted her hold, cradling him against her chest. His fingers curled into her nightgown. She began to sway again, slow and instinctive.
And then—without thinking—she began to hum.
A melody surfaced from memory. Something old. Something her mother had sung to her during stormy nights when thunder rattled the shutters.
Theron’s head lifted, recognition flickering across his tired features.
Sera closed her eyes, took a breath, and began to sing.
“O hush, my child, the night grows deep,
But Radiant fire its watch will keep,
A hearth of light against the cold,
A promise kept since days of old.”
Theron’s posture straightened. He knew this song too. Knew it the way every child raised under the Alaris banner learned it—whispered through generations, softened by years.
“Though winds may wail and shadows roam,
The Guard stands fast ’round field and home,
Their shining blades the dark deny,
Their vows as constant as the sky.”
Lucien’s cries quieted, his small body relaxing by inches.
Sera kept singing, voice soft but steady.
“So close your eyes, my little one,
And dream beneath the moon and sun,
For every spark the Radiant bear
Was once a prayer for those they’d spare.”
Theron joined in, his deeper voice weaving firmly beneath hers.
“And should the mountain’s echo wake,
Or distant wings the silence break,
Fear not the sound, fear not the flame—
No wyrm shall pass where Alaris came.”
Lucien’s breathing slowed. His fists unclenched.
“For in the storm, their light holds true,
A beacon sworn to shelter you,
A flame that neither night nor fear
Can chase from those they guard so dear.”
Theron’s hand moved gently on Lucien’s back, steady as bedrock.
“So slumber soft till morning’s rise,
Till dawnlight warms the waking skies,
For all the while you dream and rest,
The Radiant keep their silent quest.”
Sera’s voice thinned with emotion—exhaustion, yes, but a deeper tenderness too.
“Sleep now, my heart, in gentle peace,
The dark will fade, the fear will cease,
For Alaris stands through every night—
And guards you till the world is bright.”
Together, barely above a whisper:
“Sleep, little one, till morning’s light,
The Alaris banner flies tonight,
No dread shall wake, no shadow roam—
While Radiant hearts keep watch o’er home.”
Lucien sagged fully into sleep. His tiny hand loosened on her nightgown; his breathing softened into peaceful, even rhythm.
Sera held perfectly still, afraid to disturb whatever fragile comfort they’d conjured.
Theron’s hand never left Lucien’s back.
“Did we really just sing him an old war song?” she whispered.
Theron huffed a soft laugh. “We sang him what our parents sang to us.”
“It sounds… so big for someone so small.”
“Then consider it a promise,” he murmured, his thumb brushing her shoulder. “Not a magical one. Just ours.”
Her eyes warmed. “A promise.”
“Exactly.”
They stood there together—two exhausted parents, one sleeping son, wrapped in soft lamplight and the faint echo of an ancient melody.
A lullaby older than both of them, woven from the days when House Alaris had been the blazing shield beneath the sky.
A relic now.
A comfort still.
Gently, Sera lowered Lucien into his crib. He stirred once, sighed, and settled again.
She and Theron watched him breathe for a long, quiet moment.
“We should sleep while we can,” Theron whispered.
“In a minute,” Sera replied softly.
And so they stayed—
keeping quiet vigil,
hands brushing,
breath steady,
hearts full—
while their son slept beneath the fading notes of a promise old as fire.
