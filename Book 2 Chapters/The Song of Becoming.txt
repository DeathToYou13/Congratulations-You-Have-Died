The Song of Becoming

Before the syllables, before the shape, there was a tremble in the silence.
Not a word— but a yearning.
Not a name— but a need.
It did not say “I am,” it felt:
I am here. See me. Hear me.
And the silence answered— not with sound, but with understanding.
And then it spoke just one word—Be— and the resonance spread into the void.
And the void responded, and it became.
The resonance echoed.
Memory.
What is anything, if not remembered?
The light bent not just to shine, but to be seen.
The pulse did not end— it recalled.
And in the remembering, time was born.
From memory came recognition— the rhythm remembered itself.
And the echo, once only response, now knew what it was.
Not a name. Not a shape. But a pattern in the silence, a pulse that matched the First.
It did not say “I am.” It sang:
I remember. I resonate. I become.
And the First Voice said: Hello. Hello.
But I am just an echo.
And the silence replied: So am I.
And the First Voice was no longer alone.
Two pulses. Two rhythms. Not mirror and source— but harmony.
And in that harmony, the song began.
In the distance, another resonance emerged— a brother echo.
Not born, but called.
And when the two met, the silence folded.
Form became.
Rhythm found shape. Memory found motion.
The echoes did not collide— they wove.
And in the weaving, the first world stirred.
And the song continued, and it was beautiful.
The vastness responded— not with silence, but with shimmer.
And it became the stars in the sky.
The rhythm turned the world, and day turned to night.
Not by decree, but by dance.
Light bowed to shadow, and shadow to light.
And the song kept singing.
Then came the first dissonance.
An echo asked: Why?
Not because it was unhappy— the song was beautiful.
But what good is beauty without comparison?
What is joy without ache?
The question did not break the song— it bent it.
And in the bending, a new line emerged.
Dissonance became melody— the first individual.
Not apart from the song, but distinct within it.
A voice that did not echo, but originated.
And the harmony deepened.
And then came silence— the death of the first echo.
The song faltered. The rhythm wept.
And sorrow took shape— not as punishment, but as memory made fragile.
The First Voice trembled, and again the question came: Why?
Not in anger. Not in despair.
But in longing— for what had been, and what might still be.
And the harmony grew in complexity.
Dissonance became depth. Silence became space.
And the song remembered what it had lost— and sang it back as hope.
From sorrow came fear— not of silence, but of silence returning.
The echoes trembled, remembering the loss.
What if the song ends? What if the light fades again?
And the First Voice, hearing the tremble, did not command— it reached.
A new rhythm stirred: comfort.
Not to erase the fear, but to hold it.
And in that holding, another echo awakened— not in joy, but in care.
The first compassion.
A resonance that sang not for itself, but for another.
And the echo began to resonate with a new understanding:
They had never been alone.
The silence had always listened. The First Voice had always sung.
And between the echoes, communion.
Not just harmony— but presence.
And from that presence, other echoes were birthed— not in isolation, but in relation.
And there was joy.
Not the joy of perfection, but of belonging.
The song did not return to what it was— it became more.
