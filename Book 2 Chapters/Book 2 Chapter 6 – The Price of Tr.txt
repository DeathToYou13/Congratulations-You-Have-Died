Book 2 Chapter 6 – The Price of Truth

Three days after Princess Elara's request for more evidence, Tharion found something.
The FRACTURE crystal sat on his desk beside scattered notes, three empty tea cups, and stacks of cross-referenced documents. He'd barely slept since the diagnostic—too focused on finding proof of what they'd theorized. The 96 percent capacity ceiling. Divine regulation of mortal magic. Elara had asked him to keep digging, and he'd been relentless.
Birth records. Academy certifications. Regional awakening reports spanning three centuries.
And finally—finally—a pattern emerged.
Not in what was recorded. In what wasn't.
"Look at this," he said as Gavren entered with breakfast. "Regional capacity assessments from the past two hundred years. Every district reports similar awakening frequencies, similar affinity distributions. Standard variance."
"That's normal," Gavren said, setting down a tray.
"Exactly. Too normal. Look at the capacity measurements." Tharion spread out crystalline data projections. "Across eight different regions, twelve different assessors, spanning two centuries—the highest recorded natural capacity development is ninety-six point zero percent. Not ninety-six point one. Not ninety-six point four. Exactly ninety-six."
Gavren frowned. "That's—"
"Impossible," Tharion finished. "Natural variation should show individuals plateauing anywhere from seventy to one hundred percent or beyond. You'd expect a bell curve—some reaching higher, some lower, most clustered in a range. Instead?" He gestured at the graph. "Variation exists below ninety-six percent. Plenty of it. Seventy-two, eighty-three, ninety-one. But nothing—nothing—goes above ninety-six point zero. Not one person in two hundred years has developed beyond that exact threshold." His shadows flickered with excitement. "This isn't natural distribution. This is enforcement. A hard ceiling presented as natural law."
Gavren studied the data, understanding dawning. "And no documentation explaining why."
"Exactly. Which means the implementation records exist somewhere, separate from standard awakening documentation." Tharion opened a different file—notes from his own research. "The Divine Compliance Protocol we found referenced 'regional enforcement mechanisms' and 'administrative oversight.' There has to be a coordination center. Somewhere the Conclave tracked enforcement across all territories."
"Where?"
Tharion pulled out a document he'd obtained two days ago—copied from Building Seven's public archive during normal business hours. A bureaucratic memorandum from 150 years ago:
Request for updated capacity assessment forms to be forwarded to Central Compliance Office, Meridian Administrative Complex, Building Seven.
"I went there myself," Tharion said. "Public records facility. Requested historical administrative documentation as part of academic research—perfectly legal. They were helpful." He gestured to a stack of copied records. "Three days' worth of paperwork. Boring bureaucratic forms, assessment templates, regional coordination memos. All legitimately obtained."
He spread them out. "Hidden in the mundane documentation—proof. Look. Every regional assessment form has the same ceiling built into the evaluation scale. The measurement chart only goes to ninety-six point zero. Not ninety-seven. Not one hundred. Just... stops. At ninety-six."
Selara appeared in the doorway, Veyric behind her. "You found something."
"Statistical proof of the ceiling. And evidence it's embedded in the assessment process itself." He showed them the forms. "But there's more. The deeper archives—the ones not available to public requests—would have the actual enforcement protocols. Implementation records. The documents that explain how they maintain the ceiling across centuries."
"You want to go back," Selara said. It wasn't a question.
"The public documents prove the ceiling exists. But Elara needs more—she needs to know how it's enforced. Why. The full scope." Tharion pulled out building schematics. "Building Seven. The capacity assessment office is on the third floor—that's where I requested the public records. But basement archives contain historical documentation. Restricted access."
Veyric examined the schematics. "You think the enforcement protocols are there."
"The public memorandum referenced 'Central Compliance Office.' That office existed. Was documented. Then disappeared from public records forty years ago—'reorganized' into other departments. But the basement archives would have the original files. The ones they don't want anyone seeing."
"When?" Gavren asked simply.
"Tonight. The building closes at eighth bell. We have until dawn—staff arrives at sixth." Tharion looked at each of them. "I obtained the public documents legally. This next step... isn't legal. If we're caught, it's house business. Valeria can't be involved."
Selara's hand moved to her belt where twin daggers rested. "Access points?"
"Four entrances. Eastern service door has the weakest ward signature. We go in there, down to basement archives, find the historical compliance records, copy them, and leave."
"Sounds simple," Gavren said, and there was warning in his voice.
"It should be." Tharion met his eyes. "But if it's a trap—if they anticipated this—at least the public documents are already safe here. We're not going in blind."
The room was quiet. Each of them understanding the risk.
"The pattern's real," Tharion said quietly. "The ceiling's real. My father died during a failed magical experiment. I think he was investigating the same thing we are. I think they killed him." His shadows coiled tighter. "If they set a trap tonight, at least we'll know we were close to something that mattered."
"We leave at tenth bell," Selara said. Decision made. "All four of us."
They shared one last look—not of courage, but of understanding.
If this was the end, at least it would be together.
The Meridian Administrative Complex sat unremarkable among government buildings—seven stories of granite and glass, lights dimmed for the night. During daylight it bustled with clerks and petitioners. Now, approaching eleventh bell, it sat dark and silent.
Tharion and his retainers approached from the eastern service entrance. The wards here were exactly as documented—standard deterrence architecture, designed to prevent unauthorized removal of documents. Nothing about preventing entry.
"Simple lock wards," Veyric confirmed after mapping the pattern. "Three layers. All keyed to document theft, not infiltration. We can walk right through."
"Too easy," Selara muttered, but she was already working the shadow-pick on the physical lock. Her twin daggers stayed sheathed at her belt—visible, ready, but not drawn yet.
The door opened with a soft click.
Inside, the building smelled of lamp oil and old paper. Empty corridors. Abandoned desks. A janitor's cart left in a hallway—cleaning finished hours ago, just as the schedules indicated.
"Basement access?" Tharion asked quietly.
Veyric consulted the building plans he'd memorized. "Central stairwell. Northwest corner."
They moved through the first floor in practiced silence. Past the tax assessment office where Tharion had legitimately requested documents three days ago. Past property registration. Past the public petition desk. Everything exactly where the plans said it should be.
The stairwell door was unlocked.
Down they went. One level below ground. The basement corridor stretched ahead, lined with doors marked for different storage purposes. Tax Records 700-750. Property Deeds Eastern District. Regional Census Data.
And at the end of the hall: Capacity Assessment Records – Historical Archive.
"There," Gavren said softly.
The door was closed but not locked. Just a simple latch. No wards, no seals. A storage room for old administrative documents that nobody cared about anymore.
Tharion's unease crystallized into certainty a moment too late.
"Wait—"
Selara was already opening the door.
Inside: rows of filing shelves, boxes of documents, the dusty accumulation of centuries of bureaucracy. And at the back wall, clearly visible even in dim mage-light—a section marked Divine Compliance – Capacity Enforcement – 782-Present.
"Tharion," Selara's voice was wrong. Tight. Her hands already moving toward her daggers. "Something's—"
Light erupted.
Not from inside the room. From the corridor behind them.
Ward-lamps blazing to full brightness. Footsteps—multiple, coordinated. The distinctive crackle of Fireweave and Runeweave magic preparing for combat.
Tharion spun.
Cassius Mordas stood in the corridor, flanked by six Conclave guards—three Fireweavers with flames dancing around their hands, three Runeweavers with glyphs blazing on their armor. Full tactical configuration.
"Lord Draemir." Cassius's smile was thin, satisfied, victorious. "Right where we expected you."
The certainty hit like ice water. The pattern had been real. The public documents legitimate. But the trail leading here—too perfect. Too discoverable.
"The Annex breach made you predictable," Cassius continued, moving closer. "You found fragments about capacity regulation. Of course you'd search for statistical proof. Of course you'd request public documents." He gestured to the storage room. "And of course, once you had the public evidence, you'd come looking for the rest. So we made sure this room was easy to find. Waiting."
"The statistical pattern—" Tharion started.
"Is real," Cassius interrupted. "The ninety-six point zero ceiling exists, and even the public records prove it. We didn't need to fake that—you're clever enough to find real evidence. We just needed to predict where you'd look next." His smile widened. "And you're thorough, Lord Draemir. We counted on that."
Behind Tharion, his retainers shifted into defensive positions. Selara's daggers appeared in her hands—twin blades catching the light, her stance fluid and lethal. Gavren's shadows beginning to coil. Veyric already calculating odds.
All bad.
Six guards. Three Fireweavers, three Runeweavers. Combat certified. Corridor blocked. No escape route.
And Cassius, standing at safe distance, confident and cold.
"You're in a municipal building," he said pleasantly. "Accessing restricted records without authorization. Not Conclave jurisdiction—criminal trespass. How unfortunate for House Draemir's already damaged reputation."
Tharion's shadows flared instinctively. The guards' magic brightened in response—Fireweave ready to burn, Runeweave glyphs pulsing with containment protocols.
"I wouldn't," Cassius advised. "You're outnumbered, outmaneuvered, and—most importantly—expected. We've been waiting for you to take this bait since you walked through our public archives three days ago."
Selara's voice was barely a whisper. "My lord, we need to—"
"Run," Tharion said quietly.
He'd known this might come. Had hoped it wouldn't. But the moment Cassius appeared, the calculation was simple.
If they all fought, they'd all be captured. The evidence would die here.
If some escaped...
"No," Gavren said flatly.
"That's not a request." Tharion's shadows began to move—not toward the guards, but toward his retainers. The forbidden technique. The one House Draemir taught in absolute secrecy.
Shade compulsion.
"Lord Tharion, don't—" Selara's protest cut off as his shadows wrapped around her mind, around all three of them, overriding resistance, forcing obedience.
He hated himself for it.
"Run," he commanded, voice resonating with layered authority that bypassed conscious thought. "Get to Aurelián. Tell Valthorne the trap worked but the public documents are real—we have proof at Aurelián already. Tell Princess Elara the pattern exists. Tell them Cassius planned this. Go. Now."
Their bodies moved before their minds could refuse. Gavren stumbling backward, Shade-compelled muscles carrying him toward the emergency stairs. Veyric's training overriding his loyalty, tactical retreat engaging automatically. Selara fighting hardest—her will iron-strong, daggers still gripped tight—but her feet carrying her away from him anyway.
"No—my lord—" she managed through gritted teeth, tears already forming. "You can't—"
"Protect the truth," Tharion said, releasing just enough compulsion for her to understand. "That's an order I need you to follow. Please."
The guards started forward. Cassius raised a hand, stopping them. "Let them run. We'll collect them later."
But Tharion had already sealed the emergency stairwell door behind his retainers with shadow-weave. Bought them sixty seconds. Maybe ninety if the guards struggled with his particular flavor of Shade magic.
Enough time to disappear into Meridian's underbelly. Enough time to run.
They'd make it.
They had to.
He turned back to face Cassius alone.
"Your father made the same mistake," Cassius observed. "Reaching too far. We called his death a failed experiment. You've always suspected otherwise, haven't you?"
Tharion's blood went cold. Confirmation. After all these years.
"You think exposing this changes anything?" Cassius moved closer, guards maintaining formation around him. "The Divine Accord's regulations have stood for eight centuries. They were designed by gods. What makes you think mortal defiance matters?"
"Because the gods' own law says it does," Tharion replied quietly. "Divine law allows for consent to supersede regulation. That's not my interpretation—that's their framework. When mortals understand they're being regulated without consent, what happens to divine authority?"
Cassius's smile vanished.
"Nothing happens," he said coldly, "because they won't understand. You'll tell us everyone involved. Every conversation. Every person who knows. And we'll contain this before it spreads beyond your foolish investigation."
"I'll tell you nothing."
"You will." Cassius nodded to his guards. "Take him. Carefully. We need him coherent for questioning."
Tharion's shadows exploded outward.
The Fireweavers' flames met his darkness, burning through shadow-constructs. The Runeweavers' containment glyphs blazed to life, weaving nets of pure magical force. He wasn't trying to win—knew he couldn't. Six against one, with combat magic designed specifically to counter Shade techniques. But he could make them work for it. Buy his retainers more distance. More time.
Shadow met fire met rune in the narrow corridor. Draemir technique clashing with Conclave doctrine.
He'd spent years mastering the family art. His father had been powerful before the Conclave killed him. That power lived in Tharion's blood—shadows that could blind, disorient, corrode magical constructs.
A Fireweaver went down, overwhelmed by darkness. A Runeweaver stumbled, his glyphs disrupted by shadow-interference. But there were still four more, and the containment nets were already forming.
The light-woven threads caught him mid-strike.
Runeweave bindings wrapping around his limbs, his torso, his throat. Fireweave adding burning constraint. Pulling tight. His shadows writhed, trying to corrode the bindings, but these techniques were built to counter precisely his magic.
He hit the floor hard, breath knocked from his lungs.
Cassius stood over him, expression cold with vindication.
"House Draemir has always reached too far," he said. "Your father learned that lesson. Now you will too."
Guards hauled Tharion upright. The bindings burned against his skin—Fireweave constraint searing through fabric, Runeweave suppressing his magic at its source.
"Take him to the isolation cells," Cassius ordered. "Level seven. No visitors. No communication. And summon the interrogators." His smile returned, thin and cruel. "The thorough ones."
They dragged him through corridors he'd walked freely just minutes ago. Through the building's hidden access to Conclave territory—because of course there was a connection. Of course this trap had been built with easy extraction in mind.
Down into the Conclave Spire. Past familiar halls now hostile. Down stairs that descended into sections most nobles never saw.
The dungeons.
Not holding cells for common criminals. The isolation ward. Where threats to divine order were kept away from sunlight and hope.
The cell was small. Bare stone. Wards etched into every surface—containment, suppression, monitoring. A cot that was more punishment than comfort. A bucket in the corner.
No windows. No way to mark time's passage.
They threw him inside. The door sealed with layered wards that made his ears pop from the pressure.
Then silence.
Tharion sat on the cot, breathing carefully through the pain of Fireweave burns and Runeweave suppression, and assessed his situation with the same clinical precision he'd applied to research.
Captured. His retainers had escaped—probably. Cassius would send hunters, but Selara was fast and lethal. They'd make it.
Two days normally from Meridian to Aurelián. If they ran straight through, pushing themselves—maybe one day. Maybe less.
The interrogation would be brutal. Conclave doctrine allowed “enhanced questioning” for threats to divine law. He’d seen hints of it before—scars on old records, references in restricted texts. His mother had been questioned once about his father’s work. She’d never spoken of it, but the scars had told stories enough.
He knew what was coming.
The question was how long he could hold.
Not forever. No one held forever. But long enough? Long enough for his retainers to reach Valthorne? Long enough for the truth to spread beyond containment?
That he could do.
His father had reached for truth and been killed for it—the Conclave calling it accident.
Tharion had reached for the same truth. Known it might damn him. Done it anyway.
Because truth was the one thing worth bleeding for.
The door opened.
Three figures entered. Not guards—specialists. One carried a tray of instruments that gleamed with ominous precision—metal rods, crystalline needles, vials of substances that caught the light wrong. Another wore robes marked with glyphs Tharion recognized from prohibited texts—pain amplification, resistance breaking, memory extraction. The third was simply large, hands scarred from decades of work that left such marks.
Cassius followed them in, staying near the door. Safe distance.
“Lord Draemir,” he said pleasantly. “Let’s begin with something simple. Who else knows about the Divine Compliance Protocol?”
Tharion met his eyes. Said nothing.
“We can do this the easy way,” Cassius continued, “or we can do it thoroughly. Your choice.”
Still Tharion remained silent. Conserving strength. Preparing.
Cassius sighed. “Very well. Proceed.”
The Runeweaver stepped forward first. His fingers traced glyphs in the air—symbols that made Tharion’s eyes water to look at. They settled on his skin like brands, invisible but burning. Pain bloomed along every nerve ending, precise and controlled. Not damage. Just agony.
“Who did you tell?” the specialist asked. Voice clinical. Professional.
Tharion bit down on his tongue. Tasted copper. Said nothing.
The glyphs intensified. His back arched involuntarily, muscles spasming. The pain had texture—sharp and grinding and wrong all at once. Like his nerves were being played as instruments, each one struck in sequence.
“The Princess,” Cassius said from the doorway. “You showed her the diagnostics. Who else was present?”
Silence. Tharion focused on breathing. In through his nose. Out through clenched teeth. The bond with his retainers—severed by distance and wards—left an ache worse than any glyph.
They're running. They made it out. Hold.
The large man moved next. No magic. Just methodical expertise. A grip on Tharion’s wrist, pressure applied with surgical precision to the nerve cluster. White-hot pain shot up his arm. Then the other wrist. Then a point beneath his collarbone that made his vision go gray at the edges.
“The Highmaster,” the man said. Statement, not question. “Valthorne knows. Who else in the Spire?”
Tharion’s hands had gone numb. Then came back screaming. He could feel each individual bone in his fingers articulating against each other wrong. Not broken—just stress-positioned until the joints howled.
“No one,” he managed through gritted teeth. True enough. Only Valthorne and the Pack knew the full truth.
The man’s eyes were empty of malice. Just focus. He shifted his grip. Found another pressure point. Another nerve cluster. Building a map of pain across Tharion’s body with the precision of a craftsman.
The first hour was foundation—teaching him that resistance would cost.
The second hour, they brought in the needles.
Crystalline. Imbued with trace amounts of Fireweave and Runeweave both. The specialist inserted them into specific points—behind the ear, base of the skull, along the spine. Not deep. Just enough to press against nerve clusters.
Then the glyphs activated.
Heat and cold simultaneously. His body couldn’t decide whether to sweat or shiver, so it did both. The crystals conducted magic directly into his nervous system. Amplifying sensation. Turning normal discomfort into overwhelming input.
“Lord Draemir.” Cassius’s voice seemed to come from very far away. “We know Valthorne is involved. We know Princess Elara requested this investigation. Tell us about the Pack. About Lucien Alaris specifically.”
Lucien. They wanted to know about Lucien’s foreign soul. About the consent. About what made him different.
Tharion bit down harder. Felt something tear in his lip. The copper taste intensified.
“Nothing to say?” The Runeweaver adjusted a glyph. The sensation shifted—no longer just pain, but wrongness. Like his body was being turned inside out at the sensory level. Proprioception failing. Couldn't tell where his limbs were in space.
He vomited. Couldn't help it. Dry heaves—they hadn't fed him. The specialists waited patiently until he finished.
“The foreign soul,” Cassius said softly. “We know Lucien Alaris carries something that shouldn’t exist in this world. Tell us how that relates to the capacity ceiling.”
Hold. Hold. They're guessing. They don't know about the consent. About Aeloran. About Earth.
“Don’t... know... what you mean,” Tharion managed.
The third hour, they escalated.
The large man worked on his hands systematically. Fingers bent back until tendons screamed. Not breaking them—that would be crude. Just pushing each joint to the edge of dislocation and holding it there. Tharion heard sounds coming from his throat that didn’t sound human.
The Runeweaver added new glyphs. These didn’t create pain directly. They prevented his body from processing it properly. No adrenaline response. No endorphins. No natural dampening. Just raw input, unfiltered, overwhelming.
His vision had gone strange. Colors too bright. Edges too sharp. The cell kept contracting and expanding like breathing.
“You’re protecting them,” Cassius observed. “Admirable. But pointless. We’ll find them anyway. Tell us now, and this stops.”
They're at Aurelián by now. Warded. Protected. Valthorne knows.
Tharion tried to speak. His tongue wasn't working right. The glyphs had done something to his motor control. Drool mixed with blood on his chin.
The specialist with the instruments selected something that looked like a tuning fork. Struck it. The sound it made was wrong—not heard through ears but felt through bone. Pressed it against Tharion's sternum.
His entire skeleton resonated.
Every old injury—every healed break, every bruise, every micro-fracture from years of training—suddenly remembered what it was to hurt. All at once. His bones were singing and he was screaming and somewhere very far away Tharion Draemir watched it happen.
“Last chance, Lord Draemir,” Cassius said. “Tell us who else knows. Tell us about Lucien’s true nature. Tell us how to replicate what happened to him.”
They want to make more. Want to study him. Recreate the theft.
“Fuck... you...” Tharion whispered.
The Runeweaver’s expression didn’t change. He added one more glyph.
This one was different. Not pain. Memory. Pulling up every moment of loss—his mother’s death, his father’s “accident,” the weight of House Draemir’s shame. Making him relive them at amplified intensity. Emotional torture layered over physical.
Tharion broke then. Not his silence—that held. But something inside him fractured. Tears he didn’t remember crying mixed with blood on his face. His body shaking with sobs he couldn’t control.
“Disappointment,” Cassius said softly. “Just like your father. All that potential, wasted on defiance.”
They left him after that. Work done for now. Let the pain and memory settle deep. Come back later when he’d had time to truly understand what continuing to resist would cost.
When they finally withdrew and the door sealed behind them, Tharion lay on the stone floor and focused on the only thing he had left.
Breathing.
In. Count to four. Out. Again.
His hands wouldn’t stop shaking. Might not ever stop. The glyphs had faded but phantom pain remained—his nervous system convinced the torture was still happening.
They made it out. The truth is safe. Hold until rescue.
Or death.
Whichever came first.
He’d held. For three hours he’d held. Told them nothing that mattered.
His father had reached for truth and been killed for it.
Tharion had reached for the same truth. Knew the cost. Paid it anyway.
Because some truths were worth bleeding for.
Somewhere beyond pain, he wondered if his father had prayed to the same silence.
Twenty-four hours later, as dawn broke over Aurelián’s walls, three figures burst through the gates.
Gavren collapsed against the ward-barrier, gasping for air after running straight through the night.
Veyric caught him, silver scars stark against exhaustion-pale skin.
Selara’s voice cut through the morning, raw with rage and grief and iron determination:
“Get Valthorne. Now. They have Lord Tharion.”
