Book 2: Chapter 3 - When the Glass Sang

The chandeliers in Sunspire Citadel held stars.
Crystal prisms hung like captured rain, scattering pale gold over marble and silk, over the converging threads of court and Conclave, over music soft enough to sound like an apology. Servants moved in measured arcs. Nobles glided where the light was kindest. Elara moved where she must.
The dress they put her in was too bright. Radiant thread at the cuffs, a seam of hammered gold along the spine—her mother’s choices, which meant there was no choice at all. She smiled when spoken to and refused to be baited by a viscount who insisted the Aurelián trials were barbaric (“they always were, Your Highness, but now with so many—”); she swallowed her retort when an aunt remarked that grief made one gaunt (“you must eat more, Elara, rumor is an eater of girls”).
Rumor had eaten the palace for weeks. About a student at Aurelián who had called Radiance where none should exist. About the ley-lines stuttering like a skipped heartbeat across the capital. About dragons, always dragons, and an academy that suddenly mattered more than fashion. Tonight was meant to be a settling of waters—a banquet to prove the Crown could smooth the surface of any storm.
The Radiant Court had gathered in its full ceremonial weight: crimson sashes, glyph-stitched collars, rings that thrummed when they thought of law. The old lords pretended to be bored with danger, the young ones pretended to be brave. Captain Seren Valenne did not pretend anything. She stood at the dais edge in polished armor—matte black webbed with inlaid sigils—hands folded behind her back, a simple circlet at her brow. Elara met her eyes once and found the same steady warmth she’d known since childhood training: Breathe. You already know how.
“Smile,” her father murmured, passing her a goblet. King Aldric wore his crown like a blade he’d decided to lay flat. “They’re measuring you for panic. Give them poise.”
Elara lifted her chin. “If I can manage poise, perhaps the Court will do me the courtesy of managing honesty.”
His mouth twitched. “One miracle per evening.”
The musicians shifted. A quartet swept the air clear and the room’s noise thinned, drifting toward the banners that climbed the vaulted ribs. Sunspire’s windows ran from floor to sky, panes like frozen water. The city lay beyond in tiers of lanternlight, the sea beyond that—a darker blackness that sometimes, when she couldn’t sleep, whispered.
Elara was thinking of nothing at all when the glass began to sing.
It was so faint at first she imagined it—an edge of tone at the rim of silence—then the chandeliers chimed answer and the windows trembled as if a giant hand had plucked the palace like a harp. Elara’s skin prickled. Heat rose under her sternum, no, not heat—order, a lattice pressing outward from her bones, seeking a shape. She set her goblet down. Gold sloshed; the surface broke into seven-sided ripples.
“Your Highness?” Seren’s voice, low, close. Elara hadn’t seen her move but of course she had; Seren could cross a room faster than rumor could.
“I’m—” Elara tried to lie but the lie had nowhere to sit. The lattice pushed. Colors sharpened until they cut. The chandeliers stopped being chandeliers and became angles and refractions, geometry dissected by breath. The hall swam as if it were a map being redrawn. A whispering rose from her skin, far-off bells that were not bells at all.
She took one step back, then another. The air grew thinner. No, thinner was wrong. Truer. Things snapped into place: a pillar’s plumb, the curve of an arch resolving to the curve it had always wanted. A warmth like sunlight through clean water gathered beneath her heart and then, without asking permission, burst.
Light came through the seams of her, unhidden, unkind.
The first scream wasn’t hers. It belonged to a councilor who had never liked being reminded that the world had rules he did not write. He stumbled backwards, hand up as if he could ward with fingers. Others followed—gasp, chair legs, metal on stone. Some fell to their knees, because radiance had been a story for two hundred years and stories were safer when they stayed stories.
“Hold.” King Aldric’s voice cut through, trained on war. “No one moves unless ordered.”
Elara couldn’t kneel even if she wanted to. The light had a logic; it sketched sigils over her skin in bands of seven—thin-limned and exact, as if the lines had always been there and the world had just remembered to draw them. The nearest chandeliers flared and split their own beams into spectral ladders. Gold inlays on the floor warmed to a dim ember. Far away, in the city, bells began to peal where there were no bells at this hour.
“Captain.” The king again.
Seren was already there, a palm hovering inches from Elara’s sternum—not touching, ready. “Look at me,” Seren said. It wasn’t a plea. It was a simple, comfortable command, the kind her body had been trained to obey when the mind was too full. “Inhale four. Hold four. Exhale six.”
Elara tried. The breath snagged on light. Panic tried to claim the remainder. The sigils brightened in protest. The floor creaked in its old stone.
“Again,” Seren said, gentler. “You are not a breach to be sealed. You are breath moved through a shape. It’s your breath. Yours.”
Something in that word loosened a knot. Elara found four, found the pause, found the long spill out. The light eddied. Not dimmed—listened. Seren’s other hand lifted, fingers splaying. Tiny flame-threads bloomed at the tips, each no more than a candle’s worth, then wove themselves into a narrow circle around Elara’s feet—a band of fire sigils laid with the care of a seamstress. Her heat was a steadying kind: the same warmth that chased damp from boots, that kept steel faithful, that dried tears without asking about them.
“Precision flame,” Elara managed, voice a rasp. “In a ballroom.”
“I’ve practiced in worse,” Seren said. “Remember the north barracks roof?”
Elara did. They had laughed in a rain that couldn’t decide if it was rain. The memory arrived whole, a weight to hold against the light’s upward pull. She made the circle of breath again. The lattice inside her adjusted, tolerating the circle Seren marked: not a cage, a guide.
“Clear the hall,” the king ordered. “Quietly.” He did not shout. He did not need to. Guards in sun-etched breastplates moved like a tide. Doors swallowed nobles in rustles and protests bitten off when they met Seren’s unstaring gaze.
Elara’s world narrowed to a column of air and the certain lines across her palms. When she looked down, the sigils there were familiar and not: sevenfold spirals nested inside one another, each turn a question she did not yet know. Light leaked from between her fingers. The stone beneath her feet chimed again. Beyond the door, somewhere, a child laughed because the sound had tickled the bones of the city and some children are less afraid of miracles.
“Highness,” Seren said, voice even lower now, “you are not breaking. You are remembering. Let it be memory. Let it be yours.”
A tremor cut through the room. Not motion—notice. Elara felt the citadel’s wards recognize her, flinch from her, then bow the way tall grass bows when a wind returns that it once knew. The old stories said the Alaris line had sung the palace awake when it was new. For two centuries the song had been a hum in the walls no one could quite place. She heard it now in her ribs.
“Valthorne will have felt this,” the king said, almost to himself.
He had. In the Aurelián Spire miles away, a man who had given two centuries to an academy paused over a matrix of glass and light and lifted his head. Ley-lines converged on the Spire like rivers on a delta; through them, he felt the surge bloom at the capital, presenting itself like a seal under a clean stamp. The Highmaster’s hand trembled once. He put his palm to the crystal and allowed himself a small, threadbare smile.
“A true Alaris signature,” Serath Valthorne murmured to the empty study, “long sealed, now breaking free.” His voice, carried by a ley whisper, crossed stone and night toward Sunspire. He did not leave his tower. He could not. But the ley could carry more than news—it could carry permission. And he sent that, too.

The hall had emptied except for a handful of guards, three court healers who had come and then wisely stayed back, and the king who stubbornly refused to be moved even when Seren gave him the look reserved for people who mistook proximity for help.
Elara’s breath steadied. The light changed its mind about climbing and began to settle into the bones it had chosen. The sigils thinned from blazing to etched. A last flare gusted through the chandeliers and then the prisms went back to being prisms again, though each seemed to hold a private echo of what they’d just been made to remember.
Seren let the fire circle unspool. It winked out with a sound like wet wood deciding not to smoke. She didn’t step away. She left her palm where it had been, a warmth Just In Case.
“How long?” the king asked. He meant the flare, the aftermath, the upheaval, the politics. He also meant how long have you been carrying this and why did you not tell me and what will it cost us now.
“I don’t know,” Elara said. Truth, soft and terrible.
The court doors banged. A chamberlain in livery skidded, then froze under Seren’s stare. He swallowed his noise properly. “Majesty,” he said, quieter, “messages arriving from the city. Bells. Lights. A rumor that dragons—”
“Not dragons,” Seren said. “Not tonight.”
The chamberlain nodded in the way of men who will write not dragons on a note and carry it like a spell. He fled to be useful elsewhere.
“Captain,” the king said, eyes still on his daughter, “what do I tell them?”
“That Your Highness will address the Radiant Court in the morning,” Seren said, “and that the palace is secure.” She lowered her hand half an inch, offered Elara a choice by making space. “And that she is not a crisis. She is an heir who has remembered what belonging feels like.”
Elara almost laughed, not because it was funny but because her lungs had space again. She flexed her fingers. The sigils flexed with them, like gold thread catching. The first edge of awe crept under the fear. Radiance felt less like burning now and more like a room that had been locked because someone had been afraid of what it could hold.
“Will it come back?” she asked. “The…rush.”
“Yes,” Seren said. “And no. Not like this, if you learn its breath. It wants to move. So teach it how.”
King Aldric exhaled and let the general fall from his voice. For a blink he was only a father who had been waiting to be surprised by a world he had tried to keep simple.
“I’ll have the Royal Archive prepare,” he said, and that was the monarch again, assembling the scaffolds. “Resonance Division. And—no proclamations. No titles. Not yet. We do this quietly.”
“Majesty,” Seren said, which meant that buys us time.
A guard with messenger bands stepped in and bowed sharp. “Ley-line dispatch, signed Aurelián.” He held a crystal slip, still faintly warm. The king took it, felt the hum, passed it to Seren, who passed it to Elara. It was a courtesy they had cultivated: you are not a subject of the news, you are a reader of it.
Elara touched the edge and let the words climb into her. The script was clean, the voice unmistakable—She had met Valthorne twice as a child and had trusted him immediately with the honesty of children.
Highness, it read. Be at ease. The Spire stands with the Crown. The ley-lines confirm your signature. The old songs remember the right name. Breathe as if you have always done so. There was a glyph beneath the words—nothing formal, nothing binding. A sigil like a door left unlocked.
Seren smiled a fraction. “He always did know how to say three things by saying one.”
Elara folded the slip. “Do I have to sleep?” It was only half a joke. Her muscles had that drained, post-storm softness that begged for water and a dark room.
“Yes,” Seren said. “And drink, and walk the east corridor at dawn. The marble sings there—you’ll hear if you listen.”
“I heard it tonight,” Elara said. “It was loud.”
“It will be gentler in the morning.” Seren’s voice settled into the cadence of an old ritual, a training phrase from the first week she’d taught Elara to call her body back from fear. “We will make it gentler.”
The king touched Elara’s shoulder, a careful press, as if unsure whether she was made of light or daughter.
“No word goes beyond these walls,” he said, softer now and only to them. “Not until we speak it.”
Elara nodded. The right to choose had been taken from too many for too long; she would not let them take hers on the first night she’d felt it arrive.
They moved together out of the shattered order of the ballroom. The corridors beyond were lit low, portraits peering from their gilt. Servants bowed and did not look up. Somewhere in the kitchens someone was crying and someone else was laughing because crying and laughing are two hands of the same body when a palace remembers magic.
On the terrace that faced the city, the air was rinsed clean. Lanterns made islands below. In the far distance a darker pyramid rose where the land’s spine became mountains—Aurelián. She could not see the Spire itself, not from this roof and not at night, but she could feel a thread running from her sternum to a point in the world where law became learning and learning became the excuse not to kneel.
“You’ll go there,” her father said, following her gaze. “But not at dawn.”
“I know.” The thought of the academy put a steadier color at the edge of her mind, as if the idea of stone laid for the purpose of questions made the night less precarious.
Seren stood with her but a step behind, presence like a hearth built of discipline. “Breathe,” she said again, so quietly it did not have to be obeyed to work. Elara did, and the sigils in her skin answered by dimming one more shade, becoming something closer to jewelry, closer to truth kept for the right moment.
The sea breathed back. Wind made the banners gossip. The palace—which had been a story and then a warning—returned to being a house that held a family who happened also to be a country.
Elara pressed her palm to the rail. The stone was cold and kind. She let herself want a very small, very human thing: to wake tomorrow and not be afraid of herself.
“I’ll be with you,” Seren said, as if she’d been given the thought to hold. “At dawn. East corridor.”
Elara swallowed, found a smile that didn’t crack. “I know.”
They turned. The doors took them. The citadel closed behind like a hand that had just learned how to be gentle with what it kept.
In the ballroom, the chandeliers stopped casting stars and went back to casting light. In the city, rumor found a new shape for its teeth and then, bewildered by the absence of screams, found a quieter meal. In the night, dragons did not wake.
And far away, at a tower that had been a question for centuries, a Highmaster set his palm to glass and waited for morning.
