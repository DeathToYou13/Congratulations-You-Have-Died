Book 2: Chapter 1 - The Eighth Minute

he journal shouldn’t exist.
Sera finds it while sorting through damaged belongings salvaged from the main house’s library—the parts Valthor’s flames hadn’t reached. Most are ruined: charred spines, pages brittle as autumn leaves. But personal effects from the staff quarters survived in the stone vaults below.
A small trunk. Labeled: Healer Miriam Voss – Personal Effects.
Sera frowns. Miriam was the royal healer who attended Lucien’s birth. Who declared him stillborn. Who was there when he breathed anyway, and again seven years later when his magic awakened.
She’d retired recently, moved to a coastal town for her health. They’d sent her a letter about the Pact ritual’s success three weeks ago. She never replied.
The trunk contains: medical texts, old correspondence, pressed flowers. And at the bottom, wrapped in oilcloth, a leather-bound journal.
Sera almost doesn’t open it. This is private. Personal.
But the label on the spine catches her eye:
Case Study: L.A. – Anomalous Integration
L.A.
Lucien Alaris.
Her hands are shaking as she opens it.

Year 1, Day 1
Today I delivered a stillborn child to House Alaris. Lord Theron and Lady Sera’s first son. No vital signs for eight minutes. No heartbeat. No breath. No spiritual resonance.
I documented time of death at 3:47 AM.
Then, at 3:55 AM, the infant gasped.
I have delivered 847 children in my career. I have seen miracles. I have seen divine intervention. This was neither.
When that child breathed, I felt it—a spiritual signature flooding the body. Not awakening gradually, as infants do over years. Instantaneous. Full integration in seconds.
I ran diagnostics. The spiritual structure was... wrong. Not malformed—wrong. Like the soul inhabiting that body didn’t grow there naturally.
I filed my report with the senior healers. Was told to attribute it to divine blessing and stop asking questions.
I am not stopping.

Sera’s hands go numb. She keeps reading, each entry worse than the last.

Year 7, Day 34
The awakening happened today. I was conducting routine checkups when I set my diagnostic wand on the examination table. The boy—Lucien—reached for it accidentally.
The surge was immediate. Catastrophic.
I’ve witnessed 200+ awakenings in my career. They’re gradual. A trickle becoming a stream over minutes, sometimes hours. The body needs time to adjust to mana flow.
This was instantaneous. A dam breaking.
I ran diagnostics afterward. His affinity manifested as Radiant—the first magical awakening in House Alaris in over 200 years. I have no baseline whatsoever. No records of what Alaris spiritual capacity should feel like. Their power has been dormant for two centuries—no awakenings, no manifestations, nothing to compare against.
The feel of it was... I lack words. Not wrong, precisely. But unfamiliar in a way that troubles me. Like encountering a language you’ve never heard before and being unable to tell if the speaker has an accent or if that’s simply how the language sounds.
The same wrongness I felt at his birth is present, amplified now through active magical channels. But I cannot prove it’s abnormal when I have nothing to measure it against.

Year 8, Day 91
Lord Theron and Lady Sera brought me into confidence today.
Lucien has been enrolled at Dawnspire Academy under the name “Ethan.” Still on Alaris lands, but separated from the main estate. They want him to have normalcy—to grow without the weight of heir expectations and political scrutiny while they determine what his awakening means for the family’s future.
They asked me to continue monitoring him discreetly. Quarterly check-ups under the guise of “academy health requirements.”
I agreed, of course. But I wonder if they sense something too. The way Lady Sera watches him sometimes—like she’s searching for something familiar but finding only strangers.
I ran full diagnostics during today’s visit. The spiritual structure is stable but peculiar. Without any Alaris baseline from the past two centuries, I cannot determine if what I’m seeing is:
• Normal for this bloodline after 200 years of dormancy
• Unique to Radiant affinity specifically (also unseen for 200 years)
• Or evidence of the soul-body incompatibility I suspected at birth
The misalignment is measurable—minor, but present. Under normal magical use it causes no issues. Under extreme stress, however, the container and contents still don’t quite synchronize.
If he pushes too hard, I worry what will happen.

Year 10, Day 15
I’ve been researching cross-universal transplantation. It’s rare—almost mythological. But documented.
Souls moved between realms by divine intervention. Usually as punishment, occasionally as salvation.
The signs could match:
• Instantaneous awakening (unprecedented in my experience)
• Spiritual capacity that seems... displaced somehow (though I cannot prove this without baseline comparisons)
• Soul-body misalignment symptoms that persist years after awakening
• The eight minutes of death followed by sudden life
But here’s my dilemma: the Radiant affinity complicates everything. It’s been absent from this bloodline for 200 years. I have no records detailed enough to tell me what Radiant should feel like in an Alaris. I have no records of what ANY Alaris spiritual capacity should feel like.
Is the foreignness I sense because his soul came from elsewhere? Or simply because I’m witnessing something that hasn’t existed in two centuries?
My instincts—honed over 40 years—insist something is different. But instinct isn’t proof.
If my theory is correct, Lucien Alaris—the biological child of Theron and Sera—died at birth.
And another soul took his place. A soul from somewhere else. Another world, perhaps.
But I cannot prove it. And without proof, revealing my suspicions would only cause harm.

The entry stops mid-paragraph. The next page is blank. Then:

Year 12, Day 3
I cannot prove my theory. I have no way to confirm where the soul came from, if it’s foreign at all, or whether the anomalies I’m detecting are simply the natural result of dormant magic reawakening after two hundred years.
But I’ve made a decision: I will not tell the family.
Not yet. Perhaps never.
The boy is healthy. Happy. Talented. He has a family who loves him. He has friends. A future.
What would revealing my unprovable suspicions accomplish? It would shatter him. Make him question everything he is. Destroy his parents’ peace.
And for what? To satisfy my scientific curiosity with a theory I cannot confirm?
No.
I will continue documenting. If symptoms worsen, if the misalignment causes real problems, I will intervene.
But I will not destroy a child’s world based on instinct and guesswork.
He deserves better than that.

The journal ends there. The last entry is dated two months ago.
Sera sits in the ruins of her temporary library—books salvaged from ash, stacked in a summer residence that feels like camping in their own lives—and feels her world collapse.
My son died at birth.
The boy we raised isn’t ours.
He’s someone else. From somewhere else.
And a healer spent five years knowing and said nothing to protect him.
She doesn’t realize she’s crying until Theron finds her.

He finds Sera on the floor, surrounded by scattered pages, face streaked with tears.
“Sera?” He crosses to her immediately. “What happened? Are you—”
She hands him the journal without speaking.
“Read it,” she whispers. “Page twelve.”
He does.
The words blur. Sharpen. Blur again.
Stillborn for eight minutes.
Spiritual signature flooding the body.
Foreign soul.
Cross-universal transplantation.
He reads faster, chest tightening with each line.
The biological child died at birth.
Another soul took his place.
From somewhere else. Another world.
The journal slips from his hands.
“No.” His voice doesn’t sound like his own. “This is—she’s wrong. She has to be wrong.”
“Read the rest.” Sera’s tone is hollow, scraped clean of everything but grief. “The diagnostics. The awakening analysis. The misalignment symptoms.”
He does. Every page makes it worse. The clinical precision. The years of observation. The careful documentation of something that shouldn’t exist.
By the end, he can barely breathe.
“Our son died.” The words feel like broken glass in his throat. “Twelve years ago. We held him. Said goodbye. And then—”
“Someone else took his place.” Sera’s voice cracks. “And we never knew.”
Theron sinks down beside her, the cold stone floor grounding him against the vertigo of this revelation.
“Who?” he asks desperately. “Whose soul is in our son’s body?”
“The healer didn’t know. Couldn’t prove it. Just that it’s foreign. From another world, maybe.”
“Another world.” Theron tries to imagine it—realms beyond Dravaryn, places without magic. “When he was younger, he used to talk about a place called Earth sometimes. I thought he just had an overactive imagination.”
They look at each other, and Sera sees her own horror reflected in his eyes.
Silence stretches between them, heavy with implications neither wants to voice.
Sera grips the journal, wondering if she’s betrayed her son twice—first by losing him at birth, now by speaking a truth she can’t yet face.
“He’ll be here soon,” Sera says finally, voice hollow. “He sent word he was coming home after the celebrations.”
Theron nods once, sharply. Neither of them moves to stand. Neither knows how to prepare for looking at their son’s face and asking if he’s really theirs.
The summer residence feels wrong. Too small, too temporary, like they’re camping in their own lives while the real house lies in ash.
Lucien stands at the threshold, travel pack still on his shoulders. He’s been rehearsing words for days. I need to tell you something. There’s no easy way to say this. I’m not who you think I am.
None of them feel adequate.
The door opens before he can knock.
He expected joy. He expected home. Instead, the air feels like judgment.
Mother stands there. Her eyes are red-rimmed, face pale. She looks at him like he’s a stranger.
“Come in,” she says. Not warmth. Not welcome. Command.
He follows her inside, dread pooling in his stomach. Father sits at the small dining table, a leather-bound journal open before him.
Something about the worn leather binding, the precise handwriting visible even at this distance, makes his chest tighten.
“Sit,” Father says. His voice is flat. Empty of everything that usually makes it his.
Lucien sits. Sets his pack down carefully. Tries to breathe normally and fails.
“We found this,” Mother says, placing her hand on the journal like it might try to escape, “in the wreckage. Healer Voss’s personal research.” Her voice trembles despite obvious effort to control it. “She documented you. For twelve years.”
“Mother, I—”
“She says you were stillborn.” Mother’s control fractures like ice cracking. “Eight minutes. No heartbeat. No breath. No soul.”
“Then something entered your body.” Father’s voice is ice itself, his finger jabbing at the journal’s open page. “‘Another soul took his place. From somewhere else.’ That’s what she wrote.” His eyes lift, pinning Lucien with a gaze that’s half disbelief, half accusation. “Is it true?”
Silence stretches like a blade between them.
“Is it true?” Mother whispers.
Lucien closes his eyes. A flicker—a hospital bed, machines beeping, a life slipping away in a world without magic. Ethan Daniels. Thirty-five. Stolen by Aeloran’s voice promising purpose. The memory fragments, sharp and incomplete, like a dream he can’t hold. He opens his eyes, meets Mother’s gaze, and sees his own guilt reflected there.
“Yes,” he says, the word scraping his throat raw. “I think it’s true.”
The word lands like a death sentence.
Mother makes a sound—not quite a sob, not quite a scream. Something caught between grief and rage and devastating loss. Father’s hands flatten against the table, knuckles white, the wood creaking under the pressure.
“Our son died,” Father says slowly, each word carved from stone. “Twelve years ago. And we never knew.”
“I didn’t know either,” Lucien says desperately, leaning forward. “Not until right before the ritual. I swear, I thought—”
“What world?” Mother cuts him off, and there’s something dangerous in her voice now. Something that needs answers more than air. “Where did you come from?”
“Earth. I’m—my name was Ethan Daniels. I was thirty-five and then Aeloran—”
“Ethan Daniels.” Father repeats it like he’s testing poison, seeing how it tastes. “Not Lucien Alaris.”
“No. But listen, I didn’t choose—”
“You’re not my son.” Father stands abruptly, chair scraping across stone with a sound like a scream. “My son died twelve years ago and I never got to say goodbye. I never got to mourn him. Because something—someone—took his body and wore his face and let us love a lie.”
“It wasn’t a lie,” Lucien pleads, standing too, hands open, desperate. “I didn’t choose this. I was stolen too—”
His eyes catch on the words foreign soul, and something in him breaks
“GET OUT.”
The words hit like a physical blow. Lucien actually staggers back.
“Father, please, if you’ll just let me explain—”
“EXPLAIN WHAT?” Father’s voice breaks, and suddenly it’s not anger anymore—it’s grief, raw and bleeding and twelve years delayed. “That you’re a stranger? That every moment we spent with you was with someone else’s soul? That our real son is GONE and we were too stupid to notice?”
“Theron—” Mother starts, half-rising.
“No.” Father’s hand shakes as he points to the door. “I can’t—I can’t look at him right now. I can’t see Lucien’s face and know it’s not Lucien. I can’t—”
His voice breaks completely. He turns away, shoulders heaving.
Mother is crying now, silent tears streaming down her face. “We need time,” she whispers, and the words sound like they’re being torn from her chest. “We need to grieve. For real this time. For the son we never got to bury.”
“But I’m—” Lucien’s throat closes around the words. A victim too. I was murdered and stolen. There’s a body on Earth.
“You’re not our son.” Father’s tone is quieter now but harder. Absolute. “You’re Ethan Daniels. And I don’t know Ethan Daniels.”
“Please.” Lucien takes a step forward, reaching out. “Let me explain. There’s more to this. I didn’t choose—”
“I don’t care.” Mother’s voice is broken glass, sharp enough to draw blood. “I don’t care what happened. I don’t care why. Right now I just need you to LEAVE so I can fall apart without having to look at my dead son’s face.”
The words gut him more completely than any blade could.
Lucien takes a step back. Then another. His pack is still on the floor but he can’t make himself reach for it. Can’t make himself do anything but retreat from the devastation in their eyes.
“I’m sorry,” he whispers. “I’m so sorry.”
“Don’t.” Father still won’t look at him, staring at the wall like it might have answers. “Don’t apologize. Just go.”
Lucien goes.
The door closes behind him with a soft click that sounds like a coffin sealing.
He stands on the steps of the summer residence—the temporary home his parents fled to after a dragon burned their real one on Valthor’s orders, to motivate him to save the world faster—and realizes he has nowhere to go.
Behind the door, he hears Mother’s sobs. Deep, wrenching sounds of grief finally unleashed after twelve years of loving someone who wasn’t theirs.
They’re mourning. For the son who died twelve years ago. For the baby they held for eight minutes before he stopped breathing. For Lucien Alaris, who never got to grow up.
And Ethan Daniels—the stranger who stole his body—walks away into the dark.

The bond pulls him forward before conscious thought can interfere. Through it, he feels his Pack stirring—alarm, concern, fierce protective fury rising like a tide.
They’re waiting at Aurelián’s gates when he arrives. He doesn’t remember the journey. Just walking. One foot in front of the other. The world reduced to motion without thought.
Mira reaches him first, her wisp wrapping around him in gentle light. “What happened?”
“They know.” His voice sounds distant, like it belongs to someone else. “Healer Voss kept a journal. They found it. They know about the foreign soul.”
“What did you tell them?” Kaelen asks carefully, reading something in Lucien’s face that makes him gentle.
“That Lucien died. That I’m Ethan Daniels from Earth.” He laughs, and it comes out broken, wrong. “I tried to explain the rest but they wouldn’t—they couldn’t hear it. They just needed me gone.”
“They kicked you out.” Ralen’s tone is dangerous, the berserker rage stirring beneath careful control.
“They’re grieving.” Lucien can barely get the words out past the tightness in his chest. “Their son died twelve years ago and they never knew. They need time to—”
“To what?” Sienna demands, flames flickering along her shoulders despite the careful restraint she’s practicing. “To blame you for existing?”
“I’m not their son,” Lucien says flatly, and the words taste like ash. “They’re right about that. I’m not Lucien Alaris. I never was.”
“You’re their son because they raised you,” Mira says fiercely, stepping closer. “Because you’re family. Blood doesn’t—”
“They didn’t choose me.” The words come out quiet, certain, devastating. “Aeloran forced me on them. They loved Lucien. They got Ethan. That’s not the same thing.”
Through the bond, he feels their collective protest, their refusal to accept this logic. But he also feels their understanding—they know what it’s like to have identity questioned, to wonder if you’re real or just what trauma made you.
“Give them time,” Brenn rumbles, and his steady presence is an anchor against the vertigo. “They’re in shock. When they can think again—”
“Maybe.” Lucien doesn’t believe it. Can’t let himself believe it. “Right now I just need—”
“Pack,” Mira interrupts firmly. “Right now you need Pack.”
He doesn’t have the energy to argue. Lets them guide him inside, through familiar corridors that feel less like home than they did this morning. Sits where they tell him to sit. Accepts water he doesn’t drink.
And tries not to think about his parents in that small temporary house, finally mourning the son they lost.
The son he replaced without asking. Without choosing. Without even knowing until it was far too late to make it right.
The Pack stays close. Talking quietly amongst themselves. Keeping watch. Being present in the way only they can—not trying to fix it, just refusing to let him face it alone.
But it doesn’t fill the hollow space where his parents’ love used to be.
Where Lucien Alaris’s life used to be.
Where Ethan Daniels’s future was supposed to be.
He sits in the dark, haunted by two bodies—one he left behind, one that never truly fit.
The one on Earth, vegetative and breathing through machines while a family mourns. The one here, stolen and repurposed and rejected by the people who raised it.
Both families grieving. And him caught between, belonging nowhere.
The answer to whether he would have chosen this—given real choice—sits heavy in his chest.
But his parents don’t know that yet. Don’t know he’s a victim too. Don’t know there’s more to the story than foreign soul stole our son’s body.
And he doesn’t know when—or if—they’ll be ready to hear it.
